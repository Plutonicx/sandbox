"In your circumstances, my approach would be to use the personal statement to describe the kind of person you truly are.

However, I think it is worth pointing out that your anxiety that this could be a deal breaker is a reflection of the fact that mental illness is stigmatized in our society. And even though you would hope that an admissions committee would not participate in that aspect of our culture, you have no guarantee that all admissions committees at all schools you are applying to would be free from that bias, nor do you have guarantee that, once you get into a program, your peers, mentors, and the general community would also be enlightened about this.

So, the way I would encourage you to think about this is to ask yourself: if your only offer was from a program whose culture was biased against the person you truly are, would you attend anyway? The answer depends on a lot of things — for starters, can you afford to apply two or three times, or do you have to maximize your chance of getting in on the first try?

Making that assessment will let you know whether you are trying to weed out programs where you would not be appreciated for who you are, and that will help you decide what stance to take in your application (both in your personal letter and in your interviews).

And once you have analyzed your priorities, identified your resources, and tallied your cheerleaders, I hope you can take the most courageous option available to you."

"It paid extremely well if you were fast. I was not fast. They put me on ""paper"" which sounds cushy but what it really amounted to was taking 54 inch by 48 inch (that 40 number may be wrong) sheets of heavy duty cardboard and tossing them through the roller brush then banding the pallet at something like 500 or maybe it was 600 sheets. Some packs got metal banding. Some got plastic. The plastic was easiest because the bander was automatic. 

The fast guys made something like an extra $200 to $300 per week ""piece rate"". In 2 weeks I never made rate except pallet repair and I wrecked two other guys' rate for that day."

"If you are selling, you will always have to compete with whatever discounts may be available. And if you get platinum for 10-15% cheaper, then so can everyone else. That will always be a factor when trying to cashout of any game. Even MTGO which is directly tied to the US$ has lower tix prices from sellers because there is a risk factor. You'll never be able to convert at equal to 'legit' transactions.

As a vendor, if I sell you something for $10. As long as I receive the $10 for the product, I don't care how much it actually cost you. Maybe if it gets to the point that no platinum is ever purchased w/o gift cards, then I would look into it a bit. This has been discussed on the official forums to some degree already."

"Ah I'm so proud of Titania. I'm glad you all were smart unlike me and voted Ike, thanks guys.

Would comment on Soren but...eh. 

Short comments because I'm too lazy for longer ones right now.

Match 13  - **Burger Knight** Great enemy. I know Leif is great but BK is just fantastic. I've ranted about him before, but BK's backstory and everything is just awesome.

Match 14 - **Elincia** Again another character I've ranted on. She grows so so much as a person. From the small naive ruler in PoR thrown into everything to becoming a matured Queen in RD, she still makes mistakes though such as the incident after 2-E, but she rises above it. She really shows a lot of character growth and I really like that about her. 

Match 15 - **Hector** My favourite lord. I like the loud and bold ones, Hector's just awesome. Feel bad for Reyson though, sorry buddy but Hector wins.

Match 16 - **Nephenee** Partially because of shipping bias again, some ships make me like the characters involved more, okay ; ;. She is just really nice, I wish we had more/better supports from her. Eliwood is just but a bit average for my liking."

"If you don't like Jeepers Creepers consider that the plot evolves so drastically and is still pretty watchable, even for a cheesy 90s movie.  Most people watching it for the first time wouldn't expect it to go from crazy-stalker-redneck-in-middle-of-nowhere-Florida to this insane supernatural demon of legend plot structure.  I am open to disagreement.. I didn't think Jeepers Creepers was that good until I read the breakdown of the plot development in a book called ""Horror Film Aesthetics"" and was forced to consider how that movie just fools ones expectations.  On watching it again I guess I was psychologically primed to feel like it was an educational experience.

I'm obviously a big fan of Jeepers Creepers.  All that aside, Salva and Polanski are shitty people no matter how much anyone may enjoy their films.  "

"Er selv lige blevet student i sommers. Et par ting jeg har gjort, som har givet mig høje karakterer:

**De mundtlige fag (Samfundsfag, psykologi, filosofi osv.):** 

Tal med din lærer i timerne. Det er ligemeget om du stiller spørgsmål, eller svarer på spørgsmål, bare de ved du følger med.

**De naturvidenskabelige fag (matematik, fysik, kemi osv.):**

Forsøg hurtigt at finde ud af om din lærer er en af dem der ""bare"" gennemgår jeres bøger. Hvis din lærer er sådan en, så lad være med at spilde for meget tid på at skrive notater ned, da det hele alligevel står i bogen. Nøjes eventuelt med at skrive de vigtigste formler ned. Sørg i stedet hellere for at høre hvad din lærer fortæller om emnet, da det ofte er lettere at forstå et emne, hvis man får en form for kontekst. 

I disse fag er det især vigtigt at stille spørgsmål til din lærer, hvis der er noget du ikke forstår. At stille spørgsmål hjælper dig på to måder: 

1) Du får svar på det du undrer dig over

2)Din lærer ved at du følger med og at du går op i at lære.

"&gt;Since i plan to use this for my phone flashing habit I will need an SD card reader. should I build it into the PC or use an external?

You don't really *need* a card reader. You can connect your phone to the pc via the usb cable and transfer the files that way. Plus most of the rom flashing I've ever done required the phone to be connected to the computer via usb cable anyway.

But if you want - for convenience sake or if the phone is chinese/whatever and the PC doesn't have drivers to read it as a storage device, then get an external usb one. They're like [$10-15](http://www.amazon.com/Transcend-Super-Multi-Card-Reader-TS-RDF8K/dp/B0056TYRMW/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1439067944&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=card+reader+usb), no need to have one built-in."

"I remember a while back coming into this sub with the idea that when you stop eating you stop losing weight. There's a saying that goes ""you need to eat to lose weight"", and I mentioned that once here and got downvoted and blasted with facts so hard my router overheated. That just goes to show how convoluted and muddled weight loss is, because you can't make a thousand magazines/blogs/pseudoscience products out of CICO. Even still, calorie counting continues to be complicated by other sources such as:

http://healthyenough.net/calorie-counting/

http://www.caloriegate.com/calories-in-calories-out/11-experts-demolish-the-calories-in-calories-out-cico-model-of-obesity

...just to name a few.  I'm at the point now where if it works, then that's good enough for me. Is it *really* that important that I know how my body metabolizes each type of sugar and carbohydrate? No, it's more important that I lift something heavy or run around blasting angry music into my head. The less time I spent fishing for excuses, the more time I had to actually do work.

"I think it depends on the language.  If the language is pretty limited in what it allows and what it can do, it tends to lock people into thinking and doing things that way.  A more flexible language, or a language that offers more options, will encourage people to think about things more broadly, and thus I think will make it easier to transition to a different language.  

An programmer who is experienced and knowledgeable about Python is going to have a much easier time transitioning to MATLAB compared to a programmer who is experience and knowledgeable about MATLAB going in the opposite direction.  This is because the Python -&gt; MATLAB transition is mostly a matter of limiting yourself to a subset of what you are used to, while the MATLAB -&gt; Python transition requires a substantial change to your basic concepts of how programming works."

"You know what led some many in Iraq to become extremists and Islamists? An invasion which killed hundreds of thousands of innocent people, toppled their government, and created a new government which began oppressing its sunni minority.  

The Kurds have 80 ministers in parliament fighting for their culture. These terrorists broke the ceasefire after the Turkish government built a dam that would flood a village. The PKK was created in 1980, after a brutal coup that oppressed everyone, not just the Kurds. Those conditions are gone, no terrorism is justified. "

Still have occasional shitty dreams when he's on the road.

The Dutch FA are constantly lobbying for implementation but obviously their efforts have not been met with a positive answer. 

It's not fully on topic with your question but I hoped you enjoyed learning about this anyway ;D"

"It's a sad commentary on the anti-GMO crowd that they have to resort to these kinds of tactics. If they had any *actual* evidence that GMOs were harmful, they'd present it. But they don't and they know it. So instead they make these groups with carefully crafted names like ""US Right to Know"" which consist of a couple crank-jobs and then demand full access to all emails from various people they've targeted.

Knowing full well that this puts them in a ""damned if you do damned if you don't"" situation. If they refuse, these kooks can cry ""What are you hiding?!?!""

"* The FGM-148 Javelin does not require 2 people to fire it IRL. The second guy in most of the videos you watch is an instructor. The Javelin is also a OHK Anti-Tank missile. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3iA5KCa16s

TBH it should've been the games pickup weapon vs the lesser damaging M136 AT4. The AT4 is IRL a 2 hit killer. Dice just needed an AT lock-on weapon for engi's. Thus it had to be nerfed to a 3 hit killer.

* I'll give you some credit on this one. Having a minimum locking range barred with increased damage would be nice.

* Mobility hits should not happen until a minimum of 52% damage is sustained. A no angle RPG hit to the rear of a tank will deal 50-55 damage. A top down rpg to center turret ""no angle"" will deal 50-52 damage.

An alternative to the 'I want to show you something at my place' (indirect) is simply grabbing her by the hand and saying ""let's get out of here"" or ""we're leaving"" (direct). These are higher risk higher reward because it's a more dominant and confident move - recommended where her response to kino escalation has been very positive and you're confident she's DTF."

"[The basket](http://i.imgur.com/awY5vvh.jpg). Strikethroughs are items I discarded.

Face:

* ELF Hydrating Mineral Primer. Only wore once; I'm beginning to think I really don't need primer most of the time. Rotating out.
* ~~NARS All-Day Luminous Foundation (Mont Blanc)~~. Returned to Sephora.
* Benefit Erase Paste. Keeping; will do a head-to-head with this and my NYX concealers next week.
* Wet 'n Wild Coverall palette. Keeping, may add to future baskets.
* Garnier BB Cream. Expected to be unenthused, but it turns out this is great; keeping with enthusiasm. Staying in basket.
* Becca Highlight/Lowlight palette. Only used this once or twice; highlight/contour seems like so much effort a lot of the time. Rotating out.
* NYX stick blushes in ~~Magnolia~~ and Water Lily Rotating Water Lily out.

Eyes:

* ELF Smudge Pot (Ain't that Sweet). Love this! Keeping in.
* Maybelline The Nudes palette. Expected to hate this. Turned out to love it. Wow. Rotating out.
* Wet 'n Wild Dutchess Lounge palette. Used once, it was ok. Rotating out.
* Milani Bella Gel eyeshadow in Pink, Navy, Violet. Didn't use because I was too busy loving The Nudes. Rotating out.
* Benefit Roller Lash. Definitely a fan. Harder to remove than Better Than Sex, but curls nicely and the brush is harder to screw up with. Rotating out.
* ELF cream Liner (Coffee). Was fine. Rotating out.
* Physicians' Formula nude kohl liner. Didn't use. Keeping in.

Lips:

* Wet 'n Wild D-vinely Chilled. Expected to discard, but turned out to love. Got a compliment by a Sephora associate when I wore it there! Rotating out.
* Maybelline Creamy Matte in Lust for Blush. Didn't wear, less because I don't like it than because I had others I wanted to try more. Rotating out.
* Wet 'n Wild Coral-ine. Wore. Nice bright color, but formula sucks. Keeping for now because it's the only similar shade I own, but will be investigating options in the future. Rotating out with force.
* L'Oreal Blake's Red. Didn't wear. Rotating out.
* Revlon Balm Stain in Sweetheart. Didn't wear. Rotating out.
* NYX Pops. Wore. It's adequate, but that's all. Will compare with some other MLBBs when I get a chance, and probably discard then. Rotating out.
* NYX Wine &amp; Dine. Wore, loved. Rotating out.
* ~~Tarte Blushing Bride~~. Tried really hard to love, but didn't. Discarded.
* ~~LA Girl Glazed Lip Paint in Seduce~~. Goes everywhere, has no staying power. Discarded.

Steady players:

* Urban Decay Ozone pencil. Cranking through this steadily. Will probably last another few weeks, going to keep in basket until it's gone.
* Urban Decay Perversion pencil. Per Ozone. Staying in basket until gone.
* ELF HD powder. Kept forgetting to use, but will keep in basket.
* Lorac Behind the Scenes primer. It's fine. Keeping in to use up.

Not in basket, but destashed this week:

* Benefit They're Real Push-up Liner. Nope nope nope. Rage discard.
* CoverFX Custom Cover Drops in N10. Didn't match; returned to Sephora.
* 4 low-quality eyeliner pencils, because I hate pencils enough as it is."

Maybe the same type of thing could be done with two sorcerers casting disintegrate? Since Nodish steel is a magic weapon, it wouldn't be immediately destroyed. Perhaps that could sharpen it?

If not, perhaps the blade could be sharpened against two perfectly placed spheres of annihilation?"

"My biggest gripe with the series at the moment is the end game stuff. Maybe it's just me, but I swear every generation skimps more and more on the things you get to do after the Elite Four. I mean, the 3rd and 4th generations gave you quite a bit to do once you beat the game. Like Emerald: I sunk countless hours into the Battle Frontier, which was only the icing on the cake. There was also a ton of other things to do on the side. Then Gen 5 comes along, and I thought the end game was kind of lacking. Gen 6 totally disappointed me in the end game stuff. It's like we're going forward in technology but backwards in the amount of content. For me, I've always held the end game content in the Pokemon games in really high regards. It what makes a Pokemon game go from good to great. The main story of the Pokemon games have always been sort of cookie cutter, which is mostly why I feel that way. I put about 120+ hours into Pokemon Diamond before I ran out of things to do. Pokemon X gave me about 30 hours of stuff. I remember finishing everything, then sitting back and thinking, ""Well, I caught a few legendaries, did some stuff, cool. Now what?"" It's the first time I've ever been really disappointed with a Pokemon game.

In my opinion, whenever the next pair of Pokemon games come around, whether it be Gen 7 or something else, there really needs to be a great big hunk of stuff to do when you've beaten the Elite Four. A bunch of legendaries to go after. New missions and quests and whatnot. Cool new areas. Places similar to the Battle Frontier. I can think of plenty of things that could make for awesome end game content. If a nobody like me can come up with ideas, I don't see why Game Freak can't. Seriously, I'm hoping that the next games in the series fuckin overwhelm me with stuff to do. I'd be giddier than a schoolgirl. "

"I've been playing BF3 on the PS3 since launch.

It is my opinion that unbalanced teams and inequalities in team skill are inherent to the game.

How should a server or admin go about balancing a game for increased competitiveness? A high-skilled player that's killed-by-admin switched is gonna quit; I know I would. Kicking off low-level or low skill players? That would probably just depopulate the server. Random? Probably won't work because many times players are in squads with their friends. 

This is just my two cents."

"It can take years of practice to perfect switching from a g chord to a f chord without missing a beat, so don't get discouraged from stumbling when you've only just mastered the basics.  

That said, chords are by far the hardest part of learning guitar.  Each finger must be placed on the exact fret and string or it will sound very odd.  The only real way to master chords is with muscle memory which can only be obtained through practice.  

First learn and perfect the G chord, D chord, and C chord.  Focus on precision over speed, sloppy techniques are difficult to undo and prevent advancement.  Once you can snap to each of those chords in under 5 seconds per, try playing G,D,C,D,G in a loop. 

Once you can play that entire sequence perfectly 3 times in under 30 seconds, you will have ""mastered"" the muscle memory, from there it is only increasing speed. 



It will feel almost fruitless until it 'clicks' (which is when you're using muscle memory rather than focused muscle movement).   But once you have that muscle memory, it will take years to forget it. ( expression ""like riding a bike"" is related to this, bikes are heavily dependent on muscle memory )"

Just try to email developers that just got through Greenlight so you can know when they plan on releasing their game and if they want some coverage for when they do. Most developers will talk to you and will remember to send you internal testing keys before they release it on Steam (EA or not) or actual release keys for when they release it. So keep an eye on Greenlight and email developers of games that you think look promising.

"This isnt a protect the taxi industry thing. the licenses allow the drivers to operate as commercial entities, it ensures they follow a code of conduct (which seems pretty dirty as it is at times)  it also makes sure there are not 20,000 taxi's in the major cities clogging up the roads polluting everywhere but i think that the whole supply/demand would stop that from happening.

lets back up a bit here.. say that the license thing was opened up, unlimited licenses anyone can sign up, Uber is allowed to operate!

now what happens with these Uber drivers with their personal cars used ""to and from work"" or ""pleasure"" as the insurance states on them now wanting to run a business from them as an  uber driver how does that work for insurance?

thats pretty much the main thing stopping them from operating in Alberta, not the licenses. there is no personal non commercial coverage these drivers can get that will cover them selves, their passengers and any randoms on the road if they get into an accident while they are carrying people around. their current insurance will be void as they are no long ""to and from work"" or ""pleasure"" use they are now classified as a commercial entity which their standard insurance does not cover.

This is a safety issue! who cares about the licences personally i think it would be really enjoyable to see what would happen to the taxi companies if licenses didn't have a  cap and anyone could sign up lets just make sure they are safe and insured properly and that there is some way to track the person who is driving in case they do something creepy/horrible/etc.

"Yeah. I'd suggest getting an Empire Flex, V-Force Grillz, Virtue Vio, JT Flex, JT Flex 8, V-Force Profilers, or Dye i4. Those are the best masks on the market at the moment in my opinion.   
You could probably get one of those for 80 used CAD (just make sure  it's like new/has good foam).  
Hopper wise, I'd get a Prophecy Z2 or a Pinokio. You could get a Z2 for around 80 used CAD, or the pinokio for 60 used CAD. Rotors go for closer to 100 CAD.  
Tank wise, you'll end up spending around 100 on a 68/4500 tank. Just make sure it has a good amount of years left on it.    
Paintball marker wise, I'd go for an Invert or Empire Mini, GOG Extacy, or Proto Rail. You can get those used for around 150-180 CAD ish.     
Podpack with Pods is around 20 if you get it used with some pods.   
You should have some left over for lube/squeegees/tool kit/paint hauler."

"These stories make me so fucking mad. An 8 year old kid has NO BUSINESS being in or around another person's property, including fence and dogs. The kid got her hand bit off because of really bad parenting. The dog was acting like a... Dog. I have a Pomeranian who is cute, he looks like a mini lion. He doesn't mind kids, I guess, but no child is going to touch him unless: I know the kid and can help  so I can facilitate safe boundaries. I don't care how much some kid wants to pet my dog, I do not trust this society where dogs are put down left and right because parents can't say no. I took him to the dog park and a small child wanted to pet him really badly. She was polite but her mom was no where in sight. I had to say no. I feel sorry for the owner and the child. The parents should be ashamed. "

"There's also ""Evidence-Based Physical Diagnosis"" by McGee, which is the same class as the JAMA book that u/Golyteley mentioned. I think reading NEJM review articles on common internal medicine issues is a good way to get a good handle on major topics (although this is probably not too much different than reading UpToDate). Case presentations (especially the NEJM ones) can help you evaluate how good your differential disgnosis skills are, especially if you try to come up with the answer as you read along. Perhaps most helpful for me is reading the authors describing their thought patterns when approaching a certain symptom or pattern of symptoms. "

This is not an attack against their outfit RMIS. However, i would appreciate if something would be done against the individuals in the video. People randomly attacking friendlies in the air acting as bullies in the game is not only awefully retarded but annoying as well.

"Not to hijack your argument, but they seem to have the same notion will all their universes. 

StarCraft Heroes are all VERY fresh, and the WarCraft ones that are not still in the game are so influential (or referenced enough) that it makes up for it.

Really the only hero that isn't on someones mind at some point is TLV. 

Take Artanis and Rexxar for instance. WoD releases, brings back the War 3 hype - legion is releasing to bring back War 2 hype (dat ogre orc hybrid hype). Then on the other side, LoTV is releasing and Artanis has (theoretically) stopped being a fucking bitch and is gonna try to actually help people for the first time in a decade IRL. "

"I think after what you experienced a purebred dog from a reputable breeder would be a great option for you. A good breeder produces dogs with sound temperaments and can select a puppy that fits your needs.  I wouldn't rule out a puppy completely but breeders do sometimes have adult dogs (owner returned, not a show/sport prospect).

If you'd like we have a breed quiz on this sub and if you fill out the questions I'd (and others) would be happy to help narrow down a breed. 

* Do you have other pets?

* Who do you live with or are you single?

* How much shedding, barking, farting and drooling can you tolerate?

* What size of dogs do you like/are allowed? 

* How much grooming do you want to do, or how often can you pay a professional to groom him?

* What's your activity level? How much time a day can you give to walking and playing with the dog?

* How often will the dog be left alone and for how long? If needed, could you hire someone to walk your dog when you can't be home, pay for a doggy daycare, or come home at lunch to break up the day for him?

* How trainable does your dog need to be? How important is having your dog off-leash?

* Do you live in an apartment? Or moving in the next 5 years? Are there breed or size restrictions (understanding that some breeds may make it more difficult to find housing)?

* Do you understand that dogs can live up to 15+ years? 

* Do you have a fenced yard, or is there a large fenced area nearby? 

* Do you have young (i.e under ~8) children (or planning on having children)?

* Are you experienced with owning/training dogs?

* Where do you intend to keep your dog?

* What's the weather like where you live?

* What did you budget for your new dog?

* Where do you intend to get the dog from? (Breeder, shelter, breed specific rescue etc 

* What are you looking to get out of your dog? (i.e a running buddy, a lap warmer/companion, guard dog…)

* Breeds that you are interested in?"
"That's the beauty of Dota heros compared with LoL: Lol Champs are boring same incarnations of each other, Dota heroes are balanced around each hero being super OP in what they do. And as they say, if all heroes are OP, none are.

It also fixes the issue that LoL has where if the game is longer than 20 minutes, the support players might as well tab out and wait for the carries to finish the game without them for all the inpact they have. While in Dota, because all the heros are so impactful even late game engagements can be won via amazing support plays."

"I'm not a big fan of pessimism, but there wasn't the bad blood between Marvel/Disney and Sony as there seems to be with Marvel/Disney and Fox. I mean, Marvel/Disney has gone so far as to cancel the Fantastic Four comics and they've completely marginalized the X-Men. I also have a feeling that the deal with Sony is likely better than what would occur with Fox since Spiderman pretty much exists in a vacuum regarding other superheroes, so such a deal benefits Sony way more than something similar would benefit Fox, absent Marvel/Disney turning the screws to coax them into returning the movie rights.

Having the Fantasic Four back *would* be nice if not just to have the Skrulls (ownership is spilt) and Silver Surfer integrated with the rest of the Marvel Universe. Actually, the Johnny Storm - Crystal relationship would be possible if anyone wanted to revisit that, which could serve well as the tie-in you're looking for.

"Personally, I don't think there is a better way to create a cohesive sound in a multi song record than extensive pre production. It sounds like that's not what you want to hear but I don't think there's any way around that. Some projects will require less or more than others, but there's really no better way to educate yourself about the songs, the style of music, the type of sound the artist is going for ect than some good old fashioned pre pro. If it's a band your recording, seeing the band live once or twice is a great pre production tool in Itself, as you really get a sense of the identity of the band. 

This all said, I've recorded a lot of records with little to no pre production, minus maybe an iPhone demo the band recorded at practice. It is doable. You just need to find other ways to figure out what the band is all about. 

From there, when it comes time for recording, use the information you've gathered through whatever length of pre pro you've done to get the best sounds possible and closest to what you've decided it should sound like. Then commit to it. This is really the biggest thing, and this takes time to be able to commit to something and be happy with it halfway through, or at the end of the project. But if you commit to the sounds you're recording and stand by them, the record should have its own sound as a whole when it comes time to mix. It may not be exactly what you were expecting, but hey, you committed to your gut instinct and stood by your decision. The more you do this, the better you'll get at it. This is a really important characteristic of a good producer and engineer. Now granted, I'm not saying to leave something in the recording that you realized is completely wrong later on down the road if fixing it will make the song better, but it's a great rule of thumb. And also, I realize not every single song on a record should have all the same instrument tones all the time, but again, these are good rules of thumb to live by in my opinion. 

To commit is probably the single most valuable lesson I've learned since getting into audio. So many guys talk about it, and it seems so simple, but it's so true. Commit commit commit."

"There are definitely problems with tourists riding rented bikes in unfamiliar locations.

I once saw a pair of tourists (a husband and wife in their 50s) on Boston Adventour rentals (black frames with bright green fenders) on the on-ramp to Storrow from BU.  They'd stopped on their own and I think at least one of them had figured out that this was A Bad Idea.  I directed them to the nearest footbridge across Storrow since that's where they wanted to go. 

Years ago, starting the bike trail north from Mount Vernon in Virginia, I was passed by a guy who was going really fast down the first hill out of the parking lot and thought, ""that guy's going way too fast"".  A minute later I found him sprawled in the middle of the path with an egg sized lump on his forehead and something wrong with one shoulder.  Did I mention the blood?  There was some blood.  He was from out of town on a rental bike and didn't want to go to the hospital because he'd miss his flight home that afternoon.  He went to the hospital."

"I imagine the reason that they don't mention methane is due to the fact that, compared to CO2, methane doesn't persist in the atmosphere for very long. So in order to have a noticeable effect, a lot of methane would need to be released into the atmosphere at once.

More recent studies of atmospheric methane have found that, while methane emissions have been severely underestimated, they still only account for a few percentages of total global emissions."

"It's a story about marginalized people freeing themselves of a system that dehumanized them. Max, Furiosa, Nux, and the wives are all treated like commodities by Immortan Joe, and they all respond in different ways.

The wives aren't just damsels in distress. In the fight with Max, they help Furiosa. Splendid shields them both when Joe tries to shoot them. Capable shows Nux what it's like to be valued as an individual instead of used as cannon fodder, and his help is crucial to their success. Fragile helps Furiosa take out Joe by tricking Rictus. Each of the wives is an individual who contributes to the cause in significant ways.

Immortan Joe is not *just* a bad guy. He cares about his wives in his own monstrous way. He's horrified when Splendid is run over, and he even prays for her after she's dead. Joe's a family man, and he cares about the legacy he leaves behind for his sons. He's not a one dimensional villain.

Max's goal was to survive, but as the movie unfolds, he allows himself to hope for more. It's a slow, deliberate arc from reluctant ally to a man who genuinely cares about the people he's travelling with. He's an understated character, but his personality periodically shines through."

Having the UK bank account was nice because their person to person bank transfer system is quite good. So if someone at the office is organizing an event or you need to send someone money, you can just enter their account locator and send the money.

“Yes 49. Please, sit. I just went over your reports and I noticed something odd. You added to the remarks section on the Mrs. Higgins file that you would like to be her little grandchild’s godfather?” 

“Uhhmm yes… yes I did.”

“Why? Explain it to me please.”

“Well you see, old Mrs. Higgins was tough case. She would not let go of her body. I pulled and threatened her but she would not let go. I have had a bad day that day – first 37 did not show up for the mass car crash in the morning, so I was stuck dealing with all these souls by myself; then at lunch the guy took forever to choke, which then made me late for my afternoon appointment. So you see, by the time I got to Mrs. Higgins, I was already pretty worn out. When she refused to let go of her body I kind of snapped. I threw my hand up in the air and yelled: “What do you want, you old hag?” She looked me straight in the eyes and grinned a toothless grin. “Be the godfather of my grandson Mathew”, she said. First I didn’t know what to make of it, so I simply stared at her. I finally asked her “Why?” She said: “When I was a child, I had to go through many struggles. My father fought in the war and never returned. My mother did not know how to feed us. My sister died of malnutrition. After the war we immigrated to this country, hoping to escape poverty. Here we found work but from the day we arrived that was all it was: work. My mother died in her mid-forties because her body could take no more. I married Mr. Higgins but he passed away of cancer shortly after our second daughter was born. I worked and worked to pay for my children’s education. Sometimes I would have four jobs at a time. I was dedicated. I was disciplined. My grandmother’s words lingered in my mind. She once told me: “You cannot give up. If you give up, then you are no better than any animal on this planet. When the burrow of a fox collapses, the fox rebuilds it. When the bird’s nest falls, it rebuilds it. When an owl grabs a young rabbit, the mother lives on and has more babies. That is what animals do. This is how nature made all living things on this planet. You can never give up.” And I did not. I raised my two daughters. I fed them. I dressed them. I guided them. Today they are well situated and they are living their own lives. A few weeks ago my oldest gave birth to a little baby boy. I know my time has come. My body has given all it can give. My time is over. But Mathew’s time has just begun. And I want him to have a lot of time in his life. I want him to grow old. I want him to have enough time to experience the wonders, the miseries and the joys of this world and that is why I want you to be his godfather. You control his death. You can influence it. I cannot. So! I will not go ANYWHERE before you do not promise to be his godfather!” 
I didn’t know what to do, Madam. This woman looked fierce. I had read her profile. I did not think I could get her without the help of the technicians and I really didn’t feel up to dealing with all that paperwork. So I agreed.” 
“Hmmm… I see…” 

“So… can I do it? Can I be the kid’s godfather?” 

“No.”

"[Independent Police Conduct Authority](http://ipca.govt.nz).

And it doesn't really seem that unusual to prosecute police officers. One case in particular that comes to mind involved [charging several police officers with sexual offences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Police#Historic_sexual_misconduct_by_police). Then-Assistant Commissioner Clint Rickards was charged with rape, kidnapping and indecent assault (he was acquitted, two others were jailed for various things).

But arriving at the main point of this story - the officer in charge of the Criminal Investigation Branch in Rotorua, who handled the complaint made by Louise Nicholas, was charged with four counts of attempting to obstruct or defeat the course of justice, for trying to cover up the allegations made by Nicholas, and was jailed for 4.5 years.

So trying to protect fellow officers who commit crimes does happen, but generally isn't taken lightly if it gets discovered.

Edit: no, the IPCA is not internal affairs (as its name should indicate) and has no power to lay charges directly. See the reply to this comment from another user for more detailed info. Also, as far as I'm aware there is no separate body within the police that investigates police - all crimes are investigated in the same manner, whether committed by police or not. But if someone has info on this aspect and it turns out that I'm wrong, please correct me.
Also, (as far as I know) these situations/investigations generally are not referred to using the phrase ""internal affairs"" anyway because we have a government Department of Internal Affairs which is responsible for passports, citizenship, birth death and marriage registration etc, and that would get confusing."

It is amusing how often men will give advice that actually has negative connotations towards women, but since they don't realize it they think it is okay, but when RP men state it openly it is misogyny.

My cousin often says, ""ya sure its nice when a guy opens a door for me if I'm carrying 30 boxes and don't have a free hand, but it's just awkward when they run ahead of me to open a door.  Do they think I don't have arms or something?""

The first situation is generally helping a person in need and should be independent of gender.  The second situation is often what happens to women that has a negative connotation tied to it.  A lot of women themselves do not even realize it."

"Oh excellent call. One of my favorite anecdotes about Greg Daniels/Mike Judge (via Wikipedia):

&gt;Fox teamed the cartoonist with Greg Daniels, an experienced prime-time TV writer. Daniels rewrote the pilot script and created several important characters who did not appear in Judge's first draft (including Luanne and Cotton), as well as some characterization ideas (e.g., making Dale Gribble a conspiracy theorist). While Judge's writing tended to emphasize political humor, specifically the clash of Hank Hill's social conservatism and interlopers' liberalism, Daniels focused on character development to provide an emotional context for the series' numerous culture clashes. Judge was ultimately so pleased with Daniels' contributions, he chose to credit him as a co-creator, rather than give him the ""developer"" credit usually reserved for individuals brought onto a pilot written by someone else.

He literally gave Daniels co-creator status because of his huge contributions to the show, even though Judge had most of it set up beforehand. If only other major creators were so kind... *cough* Bob Kane to Bill Finger/Jerry Robinson *cough*"

Yes, shield oath is beast. It really helps hold the stragglers and adds. It does not make PLD less viable before that though, you just need to be more vigilant.

Most of the time, imo, when low level PLDs lose aggroe is because the DPS are targeting seperate mobs than what you are targetting. It helps to dance around spread out your combo between multiple enemies if you notice your DPS likes attacking their own mob.

Sometimes it helps to mark the enemies for priority as well."

I suppose my biggest question on the matter is, using the term 'oriental' vs 'Asian' is offensive due to negative stereotypes, yet the concept that this kind of style is generated from one race more than another is not considered a stereotype.

I said it on another comment but after all of this, ill avoid using the term in the future regardless of whether I think it is being used correctly or not.

Considering Im getting nothing but downvoted for simply stating why I wasn't aware that it was offensive in the first place, Im just going to leave this alone. I learned some interesting things, it has been eye-opening, but somehow this became a much more offensive issue for people than intended.

Im surprised someone isn't calling me racist for liking Asian things, at this point. Tumblr has disabled peoples ability to have a conversation. Everyone likes to brigade.

"&gt;The reason why I talked about the Iraq war was to make the point that international politics is not a popularity contest. Things are right or wrong independently of who has the better political institutions.

My earlier comment is a reply to denmark1976's post about all the things that Israel does in contrast to all the things arab counties generally do. I think Israel is right taking the land because they have policies I agree with. Policies I think are moral and just. It just so happens that the arab countries surrounding Israel do not have those policies, and (surprise surprise) want to wipe Israel off the face of the earth. A popularity contest? Half the fucking world hates Israel, several countries recognize Palestine as an independent state, and Muslims are taught to hate jews as they hate pigs and infidels. Look it up if you don't believe me, but several polls asking arabs about their worldview show how a sizable chunk of them want things like beheading of apostates, stoning of women, and punishment against those who criticize Islam. 

&gt;The problem with this is that Israel is occupying a lot of palestinian territory, but only wants a few high value parts of it. This makes a palestinian state unviable. Every nation in the world other than Israel and Iran are in agreement on this. Israel cannot just pry off certain pieces of palestine and leave the undesired carcass to rot. It need to leave it with roughly 1967 borders with land swaps for the largest settlements, or it needs to annex the whole thing. It can't just annex the best land in palestine and reject the rest because it doesn't want to deal with the people there.

Yea, I agree with you there, but realistically that's just not going to happen, even if Israel wanted it. Israel doesn't have the manpower, supplies, money, military, or the international backing to annex those lands and support that big a population. Then there are all the arab countries dying for an excuse to attack Israel that will leap at the chance to do so. Any country would do what they are doing now, which is taking resources and leaving the angry hostile population alone. It's not a perfect world, and what Israel is doing is not right, but I think the world is a better place than if an Arab country was annexing Israel. "

"&gt; Next yesr the russians and chinese will deploy more sdvsnced and capable stealth aircraft agaisnt our new over budget disfunctional F35 .

Correction, next year they will release a plane that is by most accounts roughly competitive with the F-22, which is still in service, and will be for another 2-4 decades.  They're just now catching up with planes we've released over a decade ago!  This is ignoring the fact that our allies are also nearing the end of development on their 5th gen fighters, such as the Mitsubishi ATD-X, which could also be available for purchase if need be as Japan is an ally.

Don't compare their attempts at an air superiority fighter to our attempts at a multi-role fighter.  It's like saying that they'll come out with a new tank that is superior to our HUMVEE, it doesn't make much sense.

We've also got next generation planes in the works at Boeing, Lockheed, and Northrop-Grumman.  So yes, they are already working on the next planes to beat the Russians and Chinese.

"It's a small lab, so we don't have much segregation between departments. Chemistry is a countertop and a couple of machines with a walkway separating it from heme. The specimens that will be sent out are aliquoted and placed in a basket in the fridge or freezer (or in a bag hung on the fridge by a magnet for room temp specimens). Every so often we pull a packing list and get ref lab labels and a print out and package it all up in a biohazard bag. The courier comes at around 5:45 and we have minimum staffing after 5 so we do a couple of lists a day to keep that last list from being huge! 

For blood bank our ref lab is the blood center- it's not electronically linked, and we don't often need them. If I have a complicated antibody I need identified or I want a titer, I just package up the specimen and call a private courier (our contact with them gives us one courier run a day, typically we use it once every couple of weeks but sometimes we use it several times in one day) to pick up the specimen at 11am. If it's stat or after hours, I call a taxi or even a volunteer driver. It seems risky but I've never lost a specimen doing this."

They are both movements that evolved over time, the 2824 is the current step in a chain starting from the original eterna movement it came from while the 6R15 is a decendent from the Seiko 7000 series.

The 2824 is more refined and has the swiss made street credentials.

While the Seiko is more down to earth, slower beat to reduce service intervals, its more rugged, its cheaper to service.

"How could you possibly know if someone else was punished or not? Do you stalk them for weeks and check if they still have full chat rights and if they play games? :D

Usually, it takes a couple of reports for someone to get punished, unless it's massively toxic. And if someone gets punished, you won't know about it - unless they get banned and it was your report that banned them, then you get notified that ""someone"" was punished thanks to your report. But that doesn't usually happen.

Also - negative bias and confirmation bias is a real thing. You think your Elo is toxic, and Voila, it immediately appears that way, even if it's not. Your brain automatically ignores all the games that are ""nice"" and ""neutral"" but hard remembers every game with even a single word of toxicity and you get the feeling like every game is as toxic as ever.

Honestly, I've been playing the game for like 3-4 years and the toxicity has taken a massive dive. Massive. But you still notice it, because it only takes 1 player out of 10, in a single game to make the entire game appear toxic.

So in a way, even if you go from 5 players being toxic in a game, to 1 player being toxic - a massive decrease - the game may still feel just as toxic as before. Simple because it only takes one person to fuck things up."

"Honestly, most game forums are filled with people who would rather talk about the game than actually *play* it so it's no surprise that their behavior is fairly aggressive. What's important to remember however is that they are not an accurate representation of the entire community's opinions about the game. Some people will say ""DE has managed to make the game unfun and unplayable"" for example, but the truth is that there are quite a lot of people that are currently playing the game and loving it. Just because these players don't share their positive opinions doesn't mean that they don't count, you know?

With that being said, I'm fairly sure that DE takes whatever is being said on the forums with a grain of salt. Game forums exist partially to ""contain the rage"" after all."

The average age of a truck driver is over 50 (compounded by DOT regulations requiring a prospective driver to be 21 to get his CDL but by that time they either have another career or are in school). Likewise, the LTL industry GREATLY benefits from economies of scale and the network effect -  think of how few 1-3 delivery options you have: Ups, FedEx, the newcomer (relatively speaking) DHL, and USPS (who contracts lotta of their LTL business out to the other 3.

"&gt; But this training and perseverance has little to do with intelligence.

You've spent this entire time telling me that the problem with the old system was *inherently* flawed. The problem is that the way that INT governs your skill point pool in the older system is hardly an inherent feature of the old system. While I'm far from convinced that this is the crippling flaw you're making it out to be, there are plenty of ways to change around the implementation of the skill system so that INT is a less OP attribute while still maintaining the basic outline of the SPECIAL/skill system.

&gt; You say that this is why you mention practice in the first place, but you fail to acknowledge that the practice is what's important, not the intelligence. 

Repeating an action by rote doesn't mean you're understanding it. Intelligence represents the ability to recognize the significance of what you're practicing, and how it relates to the abstract skill you're trying to hone, and it's absolutely ludicrous to say that that's not important. It's not the be-all and end-all, certainly: INT is overpowered in the last two games at the very least. But there's more of a real-world logic to the concept than you're suggesting.

&gt; This is much closer to reality than the idea that all skills are driven by a single attribute.

Which is not inherent to the old system, either. Pre-Bethesda *Fallout* games had skills that were governed by a combination of SPECIAL attributes (Lockpick was both PER and AGI, Unarmed with AGI and STR, etc.).

&gt; And I would argue that the methods used in the Fallout 4 shorthand better represent reality than the previous methods. 

Both the old and new system are almost complete abstractions: neither assigning skill points to selecting perks is much like training one's skills in reality. 

&gt; You keep coming back to the idea that there is a much higher floor and lower ceiling in regards to the lower and upper ends of the SPECIAL spectrum. Which strikes me as odd, since it further narrows the field of effective builds.

No, it doesn't. The game *itself* narrows the field of effective builds. Having a wider range of possible skill values doesn't mean the game is actually going to make practical use of values at the extreme ends of the spectrum. That's a matter of fundamental design. The devs choose to model that kind of extreme, so what's the point of having it uselessly reflected in the mechanics?

&gt; If there is functionally no difference between CHA10 bartering and CHA1 bartering, why bother with CHA10?

*In theory*, it's supposed to take a lot more time to master the art of bartering when starting with CHR 1 than it does with CHR 10. And this was at least more true in the first two games. The functional difference is that it'll take longer to master bartering and come at the expense of work you could be putting in to your other skills. That's still true, in the abstract, even in more recent games, though tweaks to the system, including but not limited to a more compressed scale (1-100 instead of 1-300), have meant that the practical difference is only a matter of a level or two at most.

&gt; The old system, that you claim is more realistic than the new, says you are just as capable of persuading people as me. 

We keep circling around this point, and that's why I don't think we're ever going to see eye-to-eye on this. Yes, I *do* think it's possible for a naturally uncharismatic person to study and practice the art of rhetoric to the point where s/he is just as capable of persuasion as a inherently charismatic person who has trained (more quickly and with less effort, granted) to the same effect. Moreover, I think it happens *all the time*, and is, fundamentally, the entire reason we bother to have an education system in the first place. You find this idea to be at odds with reality. I think that's an absurd idea, but you're obviously free to hold it. I just don't know what we're accomplishing by saying the same things to each other over and over and over again.

&gt; Put more simply; a desire to pick locks requires a cultivation of perception, and a cultivation of perception allows you to learn to pick locks

I would agree with that, with the caveats that there picking locks requires a specific kind of perception that is not likely to be directly applicable to other perception-reliant skills. I'd also emphasize that it *allows* you to learn to pick locks. Cultivating your perception (in the abstract sense, whatever that means) makes it easier for you to pick locks (and it's not likely this isn't modeled under the old system, either: raising a governing SPECIAL stat increases the governed skill accordingly), but it doesn't necessarily make it *easy*, and it certainly doesn't mean that cultivating your perception *makes* you skilled at picking locks. Since skills are being rolled into both ranked perks and base SPECIAL attributes, I'd be very surprised if we don't see a good deal of the latter, although not necessarily for lockpicking. But I think it's likely that, say, Speech checks will be replaced with CHR checks, and that's ridiculous. Natural charisma does not fully replace an understanding of rhetoric or persuasion.

&gt; But the low INT character is going to be able to complete all the same quests the high INT character can, and level for level the opportunity for growth is identical.

This is a distinction without a difference, since practically no one measures their progress through the game by levels. And what you say is equally true of earlier games: an INT 1 character may only earn a little more than half the skill points of an INT 10 character (330 versus 600 by level 30), but both characters are still more than capable of completing pretty much every quest. ""Level for level"" the growth is different, but *who cares*? Levels aren't directly relevant, either under the old system or the new: it's what they represent for character growth and development.

&gt; Given the claim of infinite leveling, at least some of the content will scale as the player levels, so it doesn't matter how fast a character levels because the challenges wil scale appropriately. Before this scaling would skew in favor of the high INT character, as they had more points to utilize at the same level. 

That's precisely why I dislike Bethesda's love of level scaling (which wasn't present in the pre-Bethesda games): it devalues levels. I don't think it makes a critical difference, though: even with a much more aggressive form of level scaling in their earlier games (*Oblivion* and *Fallout 3* either didn't use or used a much more mild form of the rubberbanding system used in *Fallout: New Vegas*, *Skyrim*, and *Fallout 4*), a higher level character still has an easier time than a lower-leveled one. A level 20 character with higher skills and more perks than a level 30 character has a easier time of it, even with the conceptually-flawed ""balancing"" of level scaling."
"That is awful. You deserve better. Nobody should threaten to leave their SO, just because the other person wants to open up about their feelings. I'm so sorry you are in that situation. If you need someone to talk to, I'm here."
"Even so, raw is inferior to the standard upgrade path in most cases. And the elemental paths are much, much better than raw if you're not gonna benefit from a weapon's scaling.

For comparison, with a longsword:

* Raw+5, 184 AR, scaling D/D

* Standard+15, 200 AR, scaling C/C

* Lightning+5, 200/200 AR, no scaling

* Fire+10, 192/192 AR, no scaling

There is no case where raw is better. The only way raw gives an edge is ease of upgrade, due to common materials (large shards only) and quickly reaching the max damage output. But it's not a long-term advantage."

"Eagles have a whole lot of roster turnover from last season.

Different RB, QB, WRs, O-line, etc. You can't just grab a whole bunch of new pieces and expect them to function perfectly right away. There's no chemistry or cohesion there. Now I'm not saying it's like the dream team, but it's a similar circumstance.

Giants on the other hand. Manning cut down on his turnovers, OBJ with a little bit more experience under his belt should improve quite nicely.

The addition of Shane Vereen alone should have an immediate impact on converting third downs.


Basically what I'm saying is Eagles might have more talent overall, albeit not by an incredibly large margin, but it takes more than talent to win games."

"I have suffered from anxiety and from similar thoughts. I sometimes worry about something going wrong with my brain and losing a grip on reality or something. As you said, totally irrational.

One thing that helps me is to realize that all of these thoughts are completely hypothetical. They're not reality. If something DOES go wrong with my brain, then I can worry and address the problem. But until something actually happens, then worrying is just silly. It doesn't make it less likely to happen if you worry about it. So, I always ground myself in what's happening now. I meditate. Can I meditate right now? Is something wrong with my brain now? The future is entirely uncertain. I don't need to know what the future holds, because I can exist in the only real moment: now."

I do a lot of research on sexuality &amp; stuff, and it seems that men DO want sex, and a lot of it (usually), but most of them also want relationships and love - just as much as women do.
(And many women also do want casual sex, in the right context. Our standards are just pickier.)
Also, even when it comes to Grindr, where it's *very* socially acceptable to say ""I'm only on here to hookup"": only 24% of men who use Grindr use it solely for hookups. 45% prefer a date but will hookup if it feels right, 10% seek only a relationship, and 18% are on it just for fun.

(It's much easier for gay men to find hookups than straight men.)

I'm sure *some* men won't want to settle down, because the only reason they do settle down is to obtain access to pussy, but you wouldn't want to be in relationships with those guys, anyway."

A decade later, responsible farming on a local scale has lifted an estimated 2.5 million people out of poverty, making the Loess Plateau Project one of the largest success stories for sustainable farming. In treating the social issues alongside the agricultural, contributors to the project have halted a cycle into seemingly irreversible destruction. It is a remarkable achievement, which those involved are confident should be adopted in similar environments, but also by domestic farmers and gardeners worldwide. Project leaders passionately claim that their project demonstrates that farmers using sustainable techniques can provide for themselves and a market, while acting as stewards of the earth.

**Type of Bug:** Interface/HUD/Font
 
**Description:** Not a bug fresh on this patch, has been doing this since around February. Basically my laptop's native resolution is 3200x1800 and when I play league I play on 1600x900 (to improve performance) the font does not scale properly. It appears very large and overlaps a lot of HUD and gameplay elements.
 
**Video / Screenshot:** [Imgur album](http://imgur.com/a/kppez)
 
**Steps to reproduce:** I'm assuming that the problem is to do with resolution (I may be wrong though). So play on a 3200x1800 screen, from in-game options go to 1600x900 fullscreen (not borderless) and the font will be huge.
 
**Expected result:** Font should scale correctly with different resolutions.
 
**Observed result:** Font appears huge and obstructively overlaps HUD and gameplay elements
 
**Reproduction rate:** 10/10 big font is in every game

I believe there is middle ground to justify the OP's thoughts on the subject and I expressed that.

"I'm three months into lifting seriously.  I spent a long time online trying to figure out which program to go with.  I spent an even longer time watching videos on form and--before I even set foot into a gym--practicing deadlifts and squats and rows with a wooden dowel.  I was going to do it on my own, with the help of the internet.

After a few weeks of lifting in the gym (being consistent, going on my scheduled days and running afterwords), I was curious whether or not my form was consistent and questions about *really, how should I be eating*?  (Seems like I can find a relatively reputable source for any kind of diet I want to eat, within reason.)  So, I did research on trainers in the area.  There's not many.  Met him, told him my goals, where I was coming from, the whole shebang, and hired him for a few sessions just to give me pointers on my form and some suggestions on my diet.  

He's done no programming for me (yet) and, over the course of the last three months, I've met with him seven times.  Generally only when I feel like I need another set of eyes on my form.  He's a good source of instant feedback rather than ""I'll take a video and post it online for a bunch of randos to comment on.""

I'm a relatively intelligent guy, but like someone said previously, I can't be a fitness expert and have all of the answers to my questions while still being able to go to the gym, work, and have a life."

"First, everyone should be able to do the tip math themselves. It is incredibly easy. You move the decimal over 1 place, and you've got a 10% tip. You double that, you have a 20% tip.

Second, everyone should be suspect of how much another person recommends you pay for their product.

Third, everyone should be suspect of these ""OMG Look at my receipt they were trying to screw me!"" It has been obvious in the past that people either were lying or didn't realize that the tip amount is based on how much you *would* have spent, and the amount on the credit card statement is how much you are *going* to spend. If there were some discount involved, such as a coupon, it is customary to tip on the full amount, so this amount may actually be accurate. Another case I have seen is that they split the check, and the recommended tip reflects the total tip, not for your particular bill. My guess here is that they split the bill 2 ways."

"That's a practical view for sure.

I think our main point of disagreement is/was in the characterization responsibility and crime. I don't see those absolute terms as appropriate when laws are unjust.

For example, are atheists and Christians *criminals* just for being born in certain societies? Do they have a *responsibility* to subscribe to their theocracy's religion? Yes, they can expect a risk of consequences, but some laws cross a certain line of morality when it comes to independent characterization."

If Parthurnaax is left alive and succumbs to his inner evil, even if that moment if centuries away, that will be the end of the mortal races of Tamriel, for there will be no Dragonborn to stand against him."

Which, in turn, supports the minimal six.

"I've had intrusive thoughts before. The earliest one I can remember is like 8 years ago. I would think about sex with random family members, but I let it go. I think that one came about from a dream or something. The pedophile one happened YEARS (about 5 or so) ago but I let that one go and haven't thought about it again until now. The hurting people one I've never had until now. I think kids are cute, but I've never been sexually aroused by them or anything. I've always had a sort of motherly instinct like any other woman. I was really into horror movies before this to be scared by them just like anyone else. 

Yes, it was. I've never really done any other drugs with the exception of marijuana every now and then. I'm not sure how much it was, to be honest. My close friends were doing it and they would dissolve it into a bottle of water and take shots of it. They'd done it multiple times before I did and always from the same source.

It's like my brain doesn't have a censor right now. These two are the worst ones but I've had other ones in the past couple months. I read this thing on the internet about some lady's husband being paranoid and killing their dog and I freaked out and started thinking, ""what would I think if I were paranoid?"" and I thought all sorts of stupid stuff. I knew they weren't real but I was worried I would believe them. Since those have passed I really just think about these two."

"Let me tell you the story of Yuri the Russian Diver. You see, Yuri, he's this middle-aged Russian worker. Hard worker, but he has to be, growing up in the poor neighbourhoods of Moscow. Doesn't like violence, so he doesn't join the army, and the only thing he's really good at is physical labour. Poor Yuri's daily routine was basically to get out of bed in his cramped, dirty little bachelor apartment, really just a hole in the wall, then walk to work through muddy streets in the summer, slushy streets in the winter, and break his back for ten hours a day to get paid thirty rubles a month. Every day, when he comes home, he falls asleep with the mantra in his head: Yuri, it's okay. Everyone has a difficult life here, and you are used to it. You are used to these hardships. Don't let them bother you. And every day, he'd wake up and do it all over again. But, one day, as he was walking home from the quarry, he sees this huge billboard on the side of a building that had just been put up. Rise of capitalism and all that jazz. On the billboard is a beautiful Russian woman in a bathing-suit, posing and flashing her pretty teeth. Under the woman is the address to the local gymnasium and the phrase: LEARN TO SWIM! TEN RUBLES! So, naturally Yuri is a bit hesitant. That's a third of his monthly earnings, but he sees the pretty girl on the advertisement and starts thinking, Yuri! Look at that! Maybe, if you go to the pool and learn to swim, you could meet a beautiful woman like that! Maybe this life of hardships and toil doesn't have to be so dull! So, Yuri convinces himself to go. He saves up a bit of money, and sure enough, a week later he is at the gym and he slaps down the ten rubles to learn to swim. Now, while he didn't meet any beautiful women there because mostly it was just lonely guys who responded to the ad, he decided not to let that ruin the investment and he took to swimming with his entire being. His Russian work ethic made him excel in all his classes, and soon, he had learned the front stroke, the back stroke, and was swimming laps like an Olympic hopeful. For a time, he was very happy, but slowly, he realized he would not meet any beautiful women at the pool, and he was not learning anything else from the novice instructors. So, he goes back to his usual life of hardships, working at the quarry, and only goes to the pool once in a while when he has a day off to keep up his swimming. But then, one day, as he is returning from work...he sees that the billboard has changed. LEARN TO DIVE! TWENTY RUBLES! With the sexy Russian woman now in a two-piece suit, nonetheless. So, once again, Yuri says: Yuri! Look at that! Maybe, if you learn to dive, you could finally meet that beautiful woman, and at the very least, swimming will be exciting again! Maybe this life of hardships and toil doesn't have to be so dull! Naturally, twenty rubles takes him a while to save up. He suffers incredible hardships, eating only the cheapest food. He doesn't pay his electricity bill for a month, and ends up spending many nights cold and shivering in addition to the usual hardships. However, it lasts only a few weeks and he has easily saved his rubles. Goes down to the gym and plunks down the money, informing the cashier that he intends to learn to dive! So, he puts all his effort into learning to dive.Learns the half-gainer, full-gainer, back-flips, swan-dives... Mastered it all in less than a week. Our man Yuri was making high-dives at the end of the month that would have put him on the jet to Olympia. Still, it wasn't enough to completely remove him from the hardships of reality. There were a few women in the class, but they were all future hopefuls that were ten or twelve years old. Yuri never met the hot woman from the billboard, but soon he was the best in his class...nay...in Russia! So he became dejected again with the fact that he could not learn anything more and started picking up overtime at the quarry instead of going to the pool. This only made him more miserable, and soon, he had accepted that his life of hardships was not going to get any better. Then, one day, he sees a new billboard up on the building as he's coming home from work. This one has a beautiful American woman on it, smiling and waving in front of the Statue of Liberty. Under the picture is: COME TO AMERICA! FIFTY RUBLES! Yuri sighs and convinces himself to keep walking. But the next day, and the next day, he sees that sign and that promise of a new life in America, and he gets to thinking: Yuri! What are you doing here? You are the best swimmer in all of Russia, and yet, you wallow in your life of hardships! You are the best diver in all of Russia, and yet you go every day to your depressing job! Yuri, maybe if you go to America, you can leave your life of tiring work and hardships behind, and finally meet some nice women! YES! Yuri, don't you see? This is a sign! So, Yuri begins to save up all his money. He eats nothing but the poorest food and even starts going to the homeless soup kitchen to make sure he is strong enough to keep working all the overtime he is pulling in. He sells all his worldly possessions minus a few sets of clothes and his bathing suit. Finally, after suffering incredible hardships - long, exhausting days and near-sleepless, shivering nights for an entire month - he is able to finally sell his little apartment and scrape together the fifty rubles plus food for the two-week-long trip by steamer. Yuri the Greatest Swimmer and Diver in all of Russia walks down to the harbour, finds the ticket counter and plops down the fifty rubles, saying to the lady: 'Take me to America! I am leaving this life of hardship behind!' Now, Yuri gets on the boat and they leave the port, heading West that very afternoon. It is a fine, sturdy boat, so his fears are lessened right away, and there are many other passengers who are like him, and who have even heard of Yuri's excellent skill at diving, so he has lots of people to talk to. In fact, he's almost a celebrity on board. But, with nothing to do but stare out the windows or wander around on the deck, everyone starts to get restless and bored. Yuri gets tired of talking about diving with everyone so he basically just sits in his cabin room and does nothing. But, of course, Yuri is used to hardships and manages to keep himself busy by imagining all the things he can do once he gets to America. In fact, one day, about half-way though the trip, he starts to figure out he could open up a swimming school, and this makes him very excited. Before he can start drawing out plans, however...BOOM! The boat slowly comes to a stop in the middle of the ocean and the captain comes onto the intercom. He says that one of the engines broke down and it will be at least three hours before they will be moving again. This makes all the bored people even more antsy, and Yuri hears many people grumbling and mad and complaining as he walks around that day. Suddenly, he comes up with an idea! He says to himself: Yuri, you are the best Swimmer in all of Russia, are you not? You are the best Diver in all of Russia, too! Why not use this time to enjoy the ocean and go for a dive? Surely the Captain wouldn't mind! And sure enough, word that an expert diver putting on a show circulates around the boat and the captain agrees, hoping it will entertain and calm the passengers as the repairs finish. The water is tranquil and beautiful. The air is warm and there have been no signs of sharks or danger for miles and miles. So, confident it is safe, Yuri finally runs to his cabin and changes into his bathing suit. He even looks at the clock to make sure he waited an hour after breakfast before swimming. When he comes up onto deck, most of the ship is there to watch. Everyone is excited and whispering: he's Yuri! The best Diver in all of Russia! This will be quite a show! Yuri, well, he is filled with happiness and confidence, so he declares to the crowd: I will attempt my highest dive ever from the top of the crow's nest! So, he climbs up the ladder to the crow's nest high above the deck. It takes him a few minutes to get up there, but by the time he has finished climbing, everyone is excited and even the crew is watching. So, without wanting to wait too long, Yuri stretches, readies himself, and even checks the air with a lick of his finger."" Yuri takes a few steps back on the crow's nest, then runs and leaps into the air! Two back flips! Then, a corkscrew! Then, a front flip! Then...BAM! Yuri missed the edge of the boat and accidentally hit the metal deck! And everyone is sure he's hurt or dead, but as everyone comes running up to him, shouting 'Yuri! Yuri! Are you alright!?! Yuri! Are you hurt? Yuri!!!' he gets up, rubbing his head painfully. Then, he turns to the surprised audience, and says: 'It's okay. I'm alright. I'm used to hard-ships

Do I get extra points because Yuri was technically a peasant?"

"I like to think that it's just a product of the young userbase. You get 18 year olds who are mostly attracted to 14-15 year olds and think ""I'm a good person, I'm attracted to young teenagers, therefore there's nothing wrong with it"". In one sense, they're right - there's nothing particularly wrong with being 18 and liking people 3-4 years younger than you. Some people like others a little bit younger than themselves. Chances are, when they're 25, they'll only like people who are old enough to drink. 

But they get it all mixed up and decide that they have to defend 50 year olds who prey on 15 year olds.

(And then you get folks on the opposite side who are so eager to prove their anti-pedophile chops that they're like ""you're 18 and you want to have sex with a 15 year old - I hope you die in a fire, you dirty pedophile!"" so it kind of reinforces their flawed ""I must defend pedophilia"" logic.)"

"My book is *Radical Life Extension: Psychological, Metaphysical, and Political Implications*.

The price is $2.99 for the ebook and $9.95 for the paperback. The ebook is free if you buy paperback. 

This book is about biomedical technologies that are currently science fiction. These technologies might help to enable a hundred year old individual to be as healthy as a sixty year old would be today, and to extend the average healthy human life span significantly. This book is meant to help reveal how what may have actually been impossible not long ago, can no longer be so easily thought of as being an impossibility.

Your way: Always a serious, productive-day-ending incident. Best case they run away, very likely case, you shoot some homeless kid,  other very  likely case, some homeless kid shits himself and stabs you. 

This way: Best and most likely  case: he takes the wallet and runs off. Much less likely case:  he's mugging you in some weirdly veiled attempt to stab a stranger... but didn't wanna  just stab a stranger right away...or something... and he goes for you anyway and you're back to shooting a homeless kid or getting stabbed yourself.

A bar that was pretty popular for underage kids got raided while I was there, and I was able to get off because I told them that I drank before I came to the bar and not after I got there. They couldn't prove otherwise, so they had to let me go. Obviously, it's the opposite case for a DUI, because you'd have to prove that you got drunk *after* they pulled you over, not before.

I remember when the first series came out and he had a tumblr fan club called the cumberbitches.
"Plumber from Houston, Texas area here. In my 8 years experience, Kohler has had the most successful, least clog prone water closets on the market. I've installed a few American Standard Champion models for some homeowners who have wanted to save $$$, and they do work, but I remember not being overly impressed by them. Yes, they can flush multiple golf balls, but that's a moot point to me. If you attempt to flush golf balls or any other product down your toilet that is not toilet paper (yes, this list includes ""flushable"" wipes and paper towels), they will get clogged up in the drain underneath your home and you're going to have a bad time.

I advise homeowners who have special needs in regards to their flushing capacity to invest in the pressure assist toilets. The brand manufacturer ""Flushmate"" licenses out their pressure tank to other manufacturers who design it in their respective toilets. There was a lawsuit not too long ago about the toilets exploding, but I'd feel comfortable with one in my house.

They are louder, but if you have special needs due to medication, diet, bellies in the sewer drain under the home in some areas, then the pressure assist is way to go. You'll never need to worry about low pressure toilets again. If you want the best residential flush toilet, go with a Kohler Cimarron. They are the best because to my knowledge there is no other toilet on the market without bolts going through the porcelain. Kohler has built a bracket around the bottom of the flush valve, eliminating the potential for leaking toilet bolts caused from failed rubber seals that typically hold together a tank to the toilet bowl. Kohler also makes the Cimarron in ADA height, which results in a more comfortable sitting position. Kohler Cimarron repair parts are very easily found, and the only thing I've seen needing replacement is the seal which allows the flush tower to close. Due to our harsh water out here, it eats away the rubber components faster, but it's a water problem, not a toilet problem.

I installed the Toto Drake at my last home about 4 years ago. They were more expensive and I bought them thinking they were better than Kohler because of their Sanigloss glaze, but I didn't feel that it was worth the extra premium. 

Also a note on the bidet seats....I had a customer call me out to his home to unclog a toilet his son threw Gack play slime in. He had a washlet seat, to which I asked him his opinions on. He said he refuses to ever use it. Perplexed, I asked him ""Why?"". He then pointed to his male twins room, looked me dead in the eye, and said ""Because I don't feel comfortable washing myself with something that gets peed on every day by my kids"". True story."

Edit: Yes, I know that some nurses are paid more than others. All I know is that my sister is a nurse, and neither she nor any of the friends that she graduated with are ""making bank,"" so take that sample of 20 or so nurses scattered across the country with a grain of salt."
"Neither of them knows how to play tic-tac-toe; in move #5, the guy playing X's failed to block, and then the guy playing O's failed to capitalize on his mistake.  Then it happens again.

"We talk about the future often , we have plans to move in together yes but procedures have to be followed .

Im just wondering why such a small favor is constantly being let down even though it wouldnt take anything away from her"

"Yes, it's pretty common to get assigned a first year course (like precalc, etc). These courses are huge and need a lot of TAs. As you gain experience you'll likely get to take on other courses, but regardless these big low level courses will probably account for a large portion of your TAships during grad school."

"&gt;Asked what he says to those “who believe you have too much influence,” Charles Koch told Gold, “wow, believe me, if I had too much, a lot of things would change. Just like the very things we’ve been talking about — this trend toward a two-tiered society and the trajectory we’re on that’s taking us there and criminal justice.”

Charles Koch's solutions for a two tiered society are what is taking us there. Reducing taxes on the highest earners has allowed them to accumulate wealth more quickly than ever, and pay out less than ever. 

A person like Charles doesn't get to a net worth of over $40 billion by being generous.

"The past three 19s I've bought beg to differ. First one I traded for a 265 dollar 1911.

"&gt;CEO does it

Awww yisss, capitalism at work, the guy who climbs his way to the top tooth and nail should definitely be paid the highest, it just makes sense.

&gt;His or her workers do it

Fuck fuck fuck this strategy is too effective; ban unions! Stop their evil negotiations for higher wages! I don't want to lose my amazingly huge salary! Unions are holding our economy hostage!!

Love for capitalism is love based on freedom of opportunity; a CEO should not be able to disrupt his or her worker's right to negotiate/take advantage of the opportunities set forth before them. The point of capitalism is class mobility and the American dream. I mean that's kind of why we rage so hard against communism and socialism.

I know ya'll probably know this, but it's just become incredibly clear to me how and why people refer to politics and economic policy as a horseshoe rather than a spectrum. Allowing CEOs to disrupt wage negotiation and freedom of opportunity for their workers throws us back into feudalism at worst, and locks people into their wage-class at best..."

"The highest OS you can install is Snow Leopard.

There are a few reasons it may not boot off the CD you burned.  The CD may not have been burned correctly or you downloaded an invalid/damaged ISO/DMG.  The optical drive may also not function correctly.  If you insert the Snow Leopard disc while the machine is booted to 10.4.11, you should be able to browse the disc and launch an installer.  Does that work?

Crafting a class legendary, even a good one like Antonidas, is usually a bad idea because it traps you to one class, and even one kind of deck. Also, Naxx is definitely worth the gold...as of now.

"That depends on how the coding is done. GPU based voxel rendering can be very fast. Here is an excerpt from [GPU Gems](http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems3/gpugems3_ch01.html) on it. 

&gt;Procedural terrains have traditionally been limited to height fields that are generated by the CPU and rendered by the GPU. However, the serial processing nature of the CPU is not well suited to generating extremely complex terrains—a highly parallel task. Plus, the simple height fields that the CPU can process do not offer interesting terrain features (such as caves or overhangs).  

&gt;To generate procedural terrains with a high level of complexity, at interactive frame rates, we look to the GPU. 

This is exactly the kind of terrain HG is trying to generate with NMS. Interesting interactive terrain with caves, overhangs, and other complex forms that cannot be done by traditional CPU height field generators."

"I think one or the other would have made her viable for sure. The stun duration let her reliably max W second though, which made her pick potential at all stages of the game ridiculously strong.

Personally I'd love to see her stun toned back to 1.2 seconds with +.2/rank (forcing at least 2 point investment for a reliable full combo), her Q buffed back up to 8% (or both form's Q nerfed to 4% and scalings increased by at least 25%)

I've been playing Elise a majority of the time for the last 3-4 months. I was happy to see her 'good' but p/b was the worst time I've had in ranked so far. It sucks having your never-banned, never-picked main suddenly unusable because she's always first pick or banned."

"&gt;Do you even know what a MAGTF is? It's a Marine Air Ground Task Force and its been used effectively since Vietnam. 

And has it ever been used to invade and control a country, so we can observe what kind of effects are associated with it?

&gt;We shouldn't have gone there in the first place.

Yeah I did re-read your comment and indeed realize this was your main point.

However, the concept of using concepts (such as MAGTF) and the idea of clean quick fixes to invasion was in my experiences a huge problem behind both Iraq 1 and 2, the idea that invasion can be done ""good"".

That is why I got pissed off at your post, because it is the kind of statement that, despite it not being your intention, encourages an increased belief in military intervention.

&gt;I feel like people skim this comment without critically reading it and then get butt-hurt because they think I'm advocating some kind of imperialistic military strategy. I'm really not. Read my other comments.

I believe you, and I apologize if my comments make you look like some bloodthirsty armydude. My point was that offering ""solutions that might have helped"" is not a good idea here. Not the way you presented it.

Thanks for discussing calmly by the way. I can imagine you have quite a few emotions about this subject."

"Yes, if no one is on the green then the one who holed out/chipped it in gets all 3.  If someone is on the green and someone else chips it in they get closest to the hole as well as ""longest putt"" atleast that 's how we play.   You can ultimately make your own rules for those situations. We just think they are rare enough that they deserve special recognition of points. 


Additionally on a par 3, if two or more people hit the green from the tee box, the point for first one on goes to whoever is also closest to the hole.   Otherwise, you play it like a normal par 4 or 5 and whoever is furthest away from the green for their second shot gets the first attempt to get on the green. 


This game is great because even if a player duffs the ball down the fairway and takes 6 strokes just to make to the green, they can still get points for closest to the hole and longest putt.   And just because you can hit GIRs, doesn't mean you walk away with all the points. "

A whiff of a particular brand of garbage bag makes me think of my middle school after-school program: and it is NOT a good smell, but my thought isn't ""It stinks"" but instead I feel all those middle school memories rushing back. 

A whiff of my SO's deodorant or cologne- scents that I didn't love at first, I distinctly remember thinking early in my relationship that his deodorant smelled unpleasantly ""Christmasy""- now bring up for me a cocktail of wonderful memories and associations, because they remind me of him, and I love him.

It's odd to me that OP's wife has been wearing this perfume for that long, and he hasn't learned to like it by now because he hasn't learned to associate that scent with everything he loves about her.

Whoever fears God will avoid all extremes.""  

We shouldn't be adding extra rules to God's word.  It leads to problems.  The biggest problem with the Quiverfull Movement is that it is an extreme.

"&gt; I wonder what you think about 2 John 1:9-11  
  
All of the commentaries I've ever read claim it's talking about a progressive movement of people who have gone ""beyond"" the teaching of Christ and his apostles. This group was going around teaching a false version of the Gospel. The warning is about not associating yourself with them so as not to give credence to the progressive claims. For the elders at the time to invite these progressives into their home could potentially give weight to the false claims.  
&amp;nbsp;  
    I also think that friendship in the Bible is very different than a modern/Western concept of friendship. Proverbs has so many warning about who to befriend and high praises about great friends. Your friends are the people who walk so so closely with you through the most difficult stuff in life. [Proverbs](http://www.biblestudytools.com/topical-verses/friendship-bible-verses/) says that they can even be closer than your siblings. It also cations about how friends can drag you into ruin, because you can become like them if you are not careful. On the other hand, they can become like you!  
&amp;nbsp;  
Also Jesus and his disciples regularly associated with sinners and people who didn't believe. I don't think anything in the bible is claiming a Christian shouldn't associate with people who don't believe. I think it does give strong warnings about allowing them to intimately guide your life in the same way an older mentor/friend would. An example of that friendship is Jonathon who was at least ten years older than David and an amazing friend."
"That isn't how it works. They don't have access to take any of your photos, contacts, or other information that you don't implicitly upload to the Spotify server. Access just means that their application can use the driver software associated with those features.

If you want to be able to upload an image from your phone to your spotify profile, I will need access to that photos feature. If you want to invite a friend to join, you need access to contacts, etc. Sometimes it is overkill. Like needing access to the camera for taking an in app pic for a profile.

Let me compare it to a real world example. Let's say you need a wheel for whatever reason. In order to get that wheel, you have to purchase an entire car. You can then take the wheel off the car, use it, and then put it back on when you are done. You aren't using the rest of the car, in fact, you don't even have the keys to open the door."

I have killed someone before. Not self defense, just straight up murder. It was a case of my life or his but he was no threat to me. I didn't even know him.

At the time it didn't bother me at all. I didn't give it a second thought when I was told to do it and I never even thought about it after i had done it.

I was broken though.

"[Overloaded Tempo Shaman](http://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/283402-tgt-overload-tempo)

Some notes:

**Unbound Elemental x2:** Might want to come out to play now that there are new tempo oriented overload cards. The same role as mana wyrm in tempo mage, this guy wins games when not removed.

**Lava Shock x2:** The other card that rewards overload. Admittedly clunky, but none of the cards require lava shock to be used with it, and 0 mana 2 damage on average isn't too bad.

**Totem Golem x2:** You're basically playing a 3 drop on turn 2 at the cost of playing a 2 drop on turn 3. This is great for tempo, since the trades will be ever in your favor.

**Flame Juggler x2:** Totem golem increases your need for 2 drops (to play on turn 3), so I landed on juggler because it can immediately snipe an aggro body and it trades well with further aggro creatures.

**Tuskar Totemic x2:** Flip a coin: if heads, you are definitely ahead now. If you lose the flip, it's not even that bad. Great 3 drop.

**Fireguard Destroyer x2:** (See Totem Golem) Putting an actual threat on the board on turn 4 can force them to waste removal on this instead of our bigger threats.

**Piloted Shredder x2:** So good I wish they nerfed it.

**Loatheb:** Great for any tempo deck since he protects your board from aoe. On an empty board he is just a hard to remove 5/5.

**Fire Elemental x2:** Solid body and an immediate board impact, also some reach in rare cases.

**Dr. Boom M.D.:** Boom bots can help clear small things off the board so Rag hits bigger stuff. All around great card.

**Ragnaros:** The biggest creature that can give immediate tempo, they will have to remove this or kill you fast because of the constant pressure he gives.

**Doomhammer:** A better finisher than Al'akir in this deck, because if you play Rag while you have this equipped you can kill two small things with it immediately and let Rag shoot the big stuff (or face).

**Ancestral Knowledge x2:** You have to draw cards somehow. I'm considering swapping one for an azure drake after some testing.

**Hex x2:** Best removal in the game. Even using it on a sludge belcher gives you tempo. 

**Earth Shock:** Great against aggro, can be used to silence taunts to let you swing for lethal.

**Crackle x2/Lightning Bolt:** I want my burn to double as removal, therefore these made the cut and lava burst didn't.

**Rockbiter Weapon x2:** 1 mana darkbomb (with some face damage) or 1 mana deal 6 when used on doomhammer. Shaman staple."

"One aspect that hasn't been addressed is that many times, people already DO pay for these things so it's just shifting who gets paid, for how long and what amount...

Most people already pay for health insurance. And pay a lot for it. So if you're having $500/mo withheld from your paycheck and that money goes to Cigna, or Blue Cross, or Humana, etc. does it matter if instead it's a tax? And because there's no longer a corporate profit component baked into it, that can now go toward covering the 10% who doesn't have coverage.

Or maybe your parents save from the day you're born toward your college, and then you pay student loans for a decade after college on the balance... so that's 32 years of somebody paying for your college. Is it that different to have an increase in taxes that instead provide universal higher education -- particularly if that means no longer paying multiples of the borrowed balance in interest?"

Yeah..the one I found on salary.com for that area..I would give them from the middle to the very top as my range as long as its not something extreme like a 60k range. And also dont give them a range like 70-75 - That is not a range.

"Of course, one cannot generalize about an entire nation of people based on the actions of a single deranged individual. (Furthermore, this was by no means my intention!) Though Fritzl claimed to have suffered extensive abuse at the hands of his mother, that seems more indicative of his own psychosis, rather than a product of Austrian socialization. I think it was largely individuals like Jelinek who, speaking within the public sphere, seized on that particular case as paradigmatic of the pathology of Austrian society to evade any sort of formal Vergangenheitsbewältigung, however what you have written also makes sense to me, and in fact it seems as if the opposite conclusion (that Austria has actually gone to great lengths to acknowledge what took place during WWII) were actually more accurate. As stated in an earlier comment, many Austrian literary and cultural figures (and Jelinek, whose literary career rests on the assumption that Austria's national character is forever trapped by it's past involvement with Fascism, is a case in point) demonstrate an affinity for characterizing Austrian society as primarily self-destructive, as perpetually oppressive, and as rejecting any sort of sympathy for the victims of Fascist regimes. 

This is, of course, only one perspective, and a slightly antiquated (if not myopic) one at that."

"I know he saw it go in and celebrated, but in that moment, for a split-second, I kinda felt like the Hawks were cheated from the initial euphoria of winning bc it took a few seconds for everyone to realize what happened and then the overhead replay showed it clearly in and the refs reviewed it.

I mean, ya can't really feel bad for them bc they won it and deserved it.  But *just* for that split-second, it felt like the CHI players missed out on the great moment when a team knows they've won the cup----either as an it winner like that was or as the clock goes to 0:00.

But hey, they won and I'm sure the players didn't care about it.  But it would've been a bit of a different scene if everyone saw the puck clearly go in the net and that instinctive explosion of joy that follows---always a cool moment.

---

Also kinda felt that way in 2008 when we beat the Pens.  They had that last-second chance that skipped across an open goal.  You can see Osgood and some other players hesitate and check the clock before celebrating wildly.  Again, DM;WC, but it would've been a different scenario if Datsyuk doesn't get tripped at center ice and just had the puck in the Pens' zone til time expired. 

It's almost like all the pressure, excitement, and joy that's built up and ready to pop at a certain moment is released just a little bit.

i feel like every time i play a carry, i can't farm faster than my team feeds.

my game today (antimage loss) was a prime example.  2 people wanting to play support, and timbersaw.  huskar went mid never called missing, dazzle was my support and never picked up any wards and auto attacked everything, timbersaw was 0-9 by the 10 minute mark against blood seeker.  i had no space to farm, and their mid and bottom lane destroyed t2 by the 15 minute mark.

i don't care about losing once, but every time i try and be a carry it becomes a coin toss on which side is worse.  when i support i know i have more control on the outcome of the game, or at least i get my lane partner fed faster.

I won FNM last night and I got languished 3 times in a game and still won just manifesting a card every turn and eventually hitting Brimaz. Soldier isnt too great in this meta, it usually gets wild slashed or searing blooded, gaining 1 to 2 life against abzan control or demonic pact isnt going to change the game either so I recommend cutting it entirely. The deck fairs well against mono red too, KotWO and a hidden dragonslayer on turn 3 is very hard for them to come back from, I beat mono red 2-0 in the finals.

"Ok first off the fact that you went to music school and analyzed music for grades does not mean you know anything about what good music is. Thats for the listener to decide. It means you learned the fundamentals of music theory in a sterile environment that is absolutely nothing like the real music industry. I know this first hand as I went to one of the top music schools in NYC on a full scholarship. But I would never claim to be an authority on all forms of music as you seem to think you are. I can however say that most of music school is utter bullshit. I find it laughable that someone would claim to be educated in the arts and then completely write off a different form of art that they simply don't understand and are unwilling to look into any further. With just a tiny bit of googling you could find a plethora of rap artists that promote educated and powerful messages through very complex and beautiful musical structures AND manage to make their music appeal to wide audience. Obviously you are to ignorant and/or lazy to have done this. But it's not too late to. I hope you can open your ears to new things because there's a lot of good shit out there. It's one thing to not like a genre based on the way it sounds to your ears (groove, feeling, timbre), but to completely generalize and stereotype an entire culture that you clearly know nothing about is just plain idiotic in my opinion.

"[**Wikipedia article** - ***Homosexual Behavior in Animals***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual_behavior_in_animals).

TL;DR: yes. *Lots* of it. Though bisexuality appears to be more common, with some species being almost exclusively bisexual. This includes the the infamous Bonobos chimps, a very close human relative that uses sex for everything from saying hello to celebrating finding food.

Sex between individuals of the same gender has been observed in pretty much every species that has two genders to choose from. Among species that form long term sexual pair bonds, some will form those pair bonds with members of the same gender.

Among some species, like elephants, long term sexual pair bondings are *only* found among same gender couples. Adult males and females live separately, meeting only during mating season, and the duration of m/f sexual interaction lasts only as long as the mating season. But within the herds of adult females, or the smaller groups of adult males, sexual pair bondings between same gender adults can last decades.

Exclusive homosexuality is rarer, but does happen. Sheep in particular have a high rate of exclusive homosexuality, to the point that farmers can purchase insurance to cover their financial loss if a stud male they bought for breeding turns out to be disinterested in females."

Mustafa Kamal left because he developed differences with the MQM leadership, so it's your own party's fault.

"Regarding the temperament, the wirehaired griffon would also be a great addition to our team. But I'm a real sucker for short-haired dogs. So the selection of dogs shrinks quite a bit if you want to stick with continental pointing breeds.

Being calmer is a plus for the old danish pointer, since one hardcore workaholic is already in the household. From what I read about the breed so far, it sounds like their backing instinct is pretty solid and the way they bond with their owner is really close, it even sounds like they are more restrained than the Vizsla, the GSP or the Weimaraner. Not that the fast and extensive work methods of these breeds are generally bad, but depending on the area you search in, a more considered and precise approach may be preferable."
"Hah, no.

Sorry ''boy'', but I don't give a shit about how the world will look like in 60 years. I will spend the most important years of my life living in privilege, that's good enough for me.

So no, I'm not calling for a ''pre-emptive truce'' because I'm worried or because I can see the ''writing on the wall''. I would simply rather live in a world where all humans can live as equals. Unfortunately you would not. 

So China with 10x of the population of America will be equal or better than the US? India and SE with possibly 2-4x the population of EU will be more bigger / more important? Well I would certainly hope so. What's insanely messed up on how the disproportionately important the west is today compared to the rest of the world. You guys really need to start pulling your own weight.

The truth, I want asians, africans, hispanics, w/e to succeed. You may not believe this, and after reading your post history which is filled with hatred and bitterness, I won't expect you to. I get no pleasure from thinking ''Ooh, my living standards are so much better than most of India.'' No, I want them to have what I have and more. 

It can't be fun living with such a narrow mind. Maybe one day you will grow up. 

PS. I could go into how much hatred asians in asia have for one another and have how many conflicts you have, which means that there's a good chance you guys will be fighting each other, not the whiteys in the future. But you don't seem to be the type of a person who responds well to facts. "

"The English league system work as follows:


* The Barclays Premier League is the top league - each season 20 teams compete in the league and the bottom 3 teams are relegated into the Championship


* The Championship is the second top league - each season 24 teams compete in the league and the top 2 are automatically prompted to the Premier League, with a third promoted via a play-offs, the bottom 3 teams are relegated


* League 1 in the third level - same setup as the championship but 4 teams are relegated


* League 2 is the fourth level - 4 promotions but only 2 teams are relegated into the national league or 'conference' as it's often referred to (there's further layers beneath that but the leagues above are the main leagues in English football)


EDIT: Should add - the top 4 teams in the Premier League qualify for the UEFA Champions League, an annual competition that the top club teams from each of Europe's major leagues compete in (so the top teams in Spain, Italy, France etc.)."

First off, your link means nothing. It doesn't explain anything. Womp womp.

But to get to the point, the source is called... PFF. Here's a fucking screenshot of my premium PFF account, of *cumulative* team grades, ranked by pass blocking, for 2014:

http://i.imgur.com/YsnDiVV.png

Well that's odd. Given that the Colts ranked 21st in pass blocking in PFF's offensive line rankings, why do they rank 26th in cumulative grade? How about the Buccaneers, who rank 32nd by cumulative pass blocking grade, but 26th in pass blocking in PFF's offensive line rankings? And on, and on, and on. 

So have we concluded that PFF's offensive line rankings aren't based on cumulative score? Or are you just going to put your blinders on? This would've taken you 5 minutes to
figure out, *if* you have a PFF account. If you don't, why the fuck are you trying to call me out on how PFF grades, and how it differs from their rankings? I've had a PFF premium
account for 5 years, believe me, I *understand* what PFF does, both with their grades, and their SEPARATE rankings. 

Anything else? Or do I have to buy you a fucking PFF account?

Sorry if this is hard to follow.  These is a *short* version of my experiences learning and understanding notation.

First I want to make sure we are on the same page to start with, so I want to define things you might already know.  I like to talk in ""standard notation.""  In standard notation, we talk about notes using just numbers and we say ""fuck the scale.""  So in standard notation, your root note is the 1.  Now, when you name any chord, the letter in the name is your 1.  So in C major chord, the root is C.  In D# Lydian, the D# is your 1.  The same note one octave up is going to be your 8.  These numbers are always in reference to some kind of base scale or chord.  

I intend on using these numbers (in this post) specifically in relation to a major scale.  We will use C major scale because then I don't have to use any extra symbols cause I'm lazy.  So our 1 is C.  So our C major scale (as I'm sure you know) is CDEFGABC.  yay.  

But lets take a moment and think about the A minor scale.  If you've never noticed, it is all of those same notes in the same order.... but you start on A instead of C.  The only difference between the scales is which note you start on.  It is actually more accurate to call them different ""modes"" of the same scale.  These modes are not things that have rules and boundaries.  A mode is describing which part of the scale you are building tension from.  The mode with the least tension is Major. Tension is very important.  Generally, the farther you go from ""home,"" the more tension you feel. 

Try this... play a C major chord, and right a cheesey rhythm using just C.  Then go up to E.... then go up to G.... and you should be able to feel some form of ""tension"" as you want it to go back toward C.  

When you play your first chord for a listener, they can establish that as ""home"" or ""center"" in their mind.  The farther you go away from that ""center,"" the more tension you will feel.  This is important.  Tension is the listener wanting to go to the next chord, trying to get closer to ""home.""  This applies to both chords *and* melody.  Home is generally the Major 1.  Why is that?  This will take a while, but is super important

First we can go up with our chord because that is so easy.  Chord are generally constructed with a chords 1, 3, and 5.  In this case I'm using the numbers in reference to a chord, not a scale.  Even if you are in a C major *scale*, the 5 of the F major *chord* is C.  This is the context when people say a chord has a 7th or 9th added.  So for our major chord, we go up to B to get our 7th.  That is far *up* as you can go in your tension.  1, 3, 5, and 7.  Interestingly, the other numbers are down...

When we think about standard notation in a major scale, you can recognize that a ""minor"" song is really just starting on the 6 chord.  When we frame it that way, A minor is going to start with A, C and E.... C!!!!! look, it has the major 1 in that chord.  Interesting!  Take another step away.... Lydian is the mode that starts on the Major 4th.  In the context of a C major scale, we get F, A, and C.... C again!!! So the chord's 5 is our scale's 4th.  That's important.  Your scales 5 chord wants to go to the 1 chord... which wants to go to the 4 chord... which is right next to 5.  We got a little love triangle going on.  These are some super popular chords.

On a C major *chord*, the 7th is B.  But what is interesting is that if add the 7th and remove your root, you actually are still playing a ""comfortable"" chord.  For example, with the C major 7 *chord*, if you remove C, you are left with E, G, and B.... and this happens to be an E *minor* chord.

That last sentence was from the context of our major scale's root.  What if our scale's 1 was our chord's 7?  We established that the 4 and the 6 chords both use the 1, but the 2 chord has the 1 as its 7th.  This is as far ""down"" from the 1 as you can go in tension.  That is how we reach down from 1, down to 6, down to 4, down to 2.   

Think about them all in order now... 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7.  The 1 is right in the middle.  This is a visual representation of why we think of it as the ""center.""  In reality, we have another octave that lines up with it, and we make them over lap. And that makes it seem much more dense.

The entire act of tension is playing around the 1.  Going in circles, and fooling the listener.  Always feeling like we are getting closer.  That is the *idea* at least.

"In this list, the author lumps gender critical feminists (whom he calls TERFs/SWERFs) in with MRAs, Anti-Vaxxers, North Korea Apologists, among others.

The section is a classic case of projection.   He says that:

“TERFs believe in a rigid definition of birth sex, defining a woman as a person born with a vagina”.  

Imagine that, it’s “misguided” to define women by biological facts!   Apparently, it’s not misguided to think that you can pick your sex like you pick your clothes and to believe that feelings are more important than biological reality!

Continuing with the projection, he accuses gender critical feminists of perpetuating gender role stereotypes, while claiming to be fighting them, again getting it bass ackwards:
&gt; 
&gt; “Many feminists claim TERFs can’t be described as radical feminists at all, as the radical feminist movement is committed to opposing the sex-gender system that places men and women into strict gender roles, a system that has been used historically to dominate women. By refusing to accept transgender people, TERFs reinforce that system of oppression.”

Never mind that transgenderists believe these stereotypes are innate traits for each sex and that if your personality doesn’t “match” the stereotype, then you have to change your body to “match”.  You can’t just ignore them and be happy as your naturally mismatching self because these stereotypes are neither innate nor necessary to being a member of the sex you were born.  They confuse what is customary with what is natural.

The rest of the section goes on to castigate readical feminists for not supporting sex workers."

"Personally, I like the look of different shades of wood in the same area.  We have medium (not super dark, not natural wood light, but in the middle) oak flooring in our living area adjacent to the kitchen, and we are about to facelift with much lighter cabinets.  Most woods with different stains mix well.  Dark colors make spaces feel smaller, light colors bigger.  Whether or not your dark floors are a ""problem"" can be partially a function of how much natural light comes in and the size of the room.

That said, may I recommend porcelain tile in the kitchen?  In the kicthen, you drop things.  Sometimes those dropped things are heavy, and when they hit just right, they will chip your tile.  With ceramic, that means the top (pretty) layer gets chipped off, and now you see the much darker, unfinished layer beneath.  It usually stands out like a sore thumb, and the only option is to replace a single tile which is a pain.  With porcelain tile, the color of the tile is the same all the way through the tile.  If it chips, the chipped area is *much* less noticeable."

"You have a lot of options for free software for editing.  
The current program I use is a free software called Paint.NET, although it is very limited as opposed to Photoshop.  
GIMP is an alternate program that is free that you can also use but I tend to stick with Paint.NET and occasionally use Photoshop. There's many free downloads for Photoshop, but if you want to play it safe, start off with GIMP or Paint.NET because both are very good programs for editing.  
Every editing technique varies from person to person, so it's better for you to find your own technique rather than me telling you what to do. What I can tell you is that DeviantART tutorials are *very* helpful! And DeviantART is a great source for finding things such as textures or resources for your own edits! 
 I've been practicing for about nearly 3 years or more now and trying out different techniques such as the scrapbook technique which I was never really into. I wish you good luck!"

"I posted this somewhere else but it applies here too.

New Zealand occupies 100,000 sq mi and has a population of 4,500,000. The Houston-Woodlands-Sugar land area has a population of 6,500,000 in only 10,000 sq mi. It's part of a triangle of metropolitan areas that together contain only 75% of Texas's population (17,000,000 people). The other 5,600,000 people (120% of new Zealand's population) occupy 200,000 sq mi of land area (twice the size of New Zealand) without a major metro center to support it. How would solar panels that already have to support 17,000,000 people in only 60,000 sq mi also be able to support the energy needs of 5,600,000 people over an additional 200,000 sq mi? 

Energy transmission over that distance is inefficient, which is why we use coal. We can produce an essentially endless amount of energy to compensate for massive transmission losses. With solar energy, the cities would already be struggling to support their own energy needs, while having nothing left to distribute to the rest of Texas. With oil, we have to actively use less than our full supply. With solar we have no control over the supply.

And as far as the United States goes, Texas has 5 of the 20 biggest cities in the U.S. How do we support the interior of the U.S., which lacks anything resembling the metropolitan area coverage you'll find on the coasts? The U.S. covers 3,800,000 sq mi (**38** times more land area than New Zealand or Germany), with 60,000,000 people (75% of Germany's population and **1333%** of New Zealand's population) living outside of the broadly defined ""urban areas"". It's possible to supplement energy usage throughout the U.S. but it is *not* possible to make substantial substitutions."

"Who's forgotten the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki? No one here, as far as I can tell. And all cities are ""civilian"" to my knowledge. But those bombings were not ""war crimes,"" in much the same way that the firebombings of Chongqing, London, Coventry, Hamburg, Dresden, Frampol, Wielun, Kobe, Tokyo and most of the rest of Japan's major cities were not deemed ""war crimes."" They are considered merely ""war"" -- horrible, destructive, merciless and awful.

Many more people were killed in the conventional bombings of Japanese cities than were killed in the atomic attacks. And yet, the consensus is that those two attacks, and the awesome power for destruction they demonstrated -- combined with the United States' broadcast threat to continue their use -- finally drove home to Japanese leadership the futility of continuing the war, thus forcing their surrender and the saving of untold numbers of lives in an invasion of the home islands.

The argument that being killed in an atomic bombing of your city is somehow worse than being killed in a firebombing of your city is ridiculous. The bombings were not ""crimes"" nor are the opinions of anyone here ""criminal."" "

"I would sit down and explain to her what it means to you, but at the same time just try to be open to her feelings on the matter. Chances are she's just afraid of the effect the drug has already taken on you. From what you've described you do sound a little obsessed (but not that I can blame you, I've been there myself.) Just remember what it looks like from her perspective. You haven't even tried the drug and you already cannot stop thinking about it. She's probably afraid of this becoming the center of your life, and because drugs can sometimes do harm she worries that she'll lose you them.

I think you just have to show her that it's just pre-flight excitement. Remind her (probably just by changing the subject of conversation,) that you still care about all of the things you did before and that this is part of a spiritual journey for you, not a vice. Also try to share as much of it with her as you can. Not so much the doing of the drug, but the ways people have benefited from it. If you waterboard her with info about how the experience will be, you will just sound like a junkie (it's sad but true.) However, if you focus on the after effects and how people's lives are improved. Then she might see that you are not just looking for a selfish high, but a selfless understanding of the world.

"This post makes me believe you're trolling, but just in case you're not:

A. Pride parades aren't really relevant to this topic.  If you think they're sinful, that's your business I guess, but the opposite of not being sexually repressed is not to be in a gay pride parade.  There's a lot of notches along the way.  

I'm not advocating promiscuity or anything. Just a healthy understanding of the existence and purpose of human sexuality. It's a part of life, and just dismissing it as wholesale impure or refusing to acknowledge it at all is asking for trouble.  You can't keep a human (unless they're asexual, which is not the vast majority of people) from experiencing sexual desire.  Kids should be equipped with how to appropriately channel those desires.  

&gt;what are the odds that the person who writes this views watersports (urinating on someone or in his mouth, for those unaware) as an ""appropriate channel"" for sexuality because it's between Two Consenting Adults

Not sure how you got that by saying there's an appropriate way to be sexual as a human being I'm advocating water sports.  I don't, uh, really think about ""watersports.""  I don't particularly care what two consenting adults do in privacy, because it has nothing to do with me.  That's between them and God.  But I certainly think two consenting adults expressing their sexuality is more favorable than harming a child or adultry.  

I think maybe you should do some self reflection and chat with God about this, because this post seems to imply more abut you than it does people who advocate educating children about what's going to happen to them post-puberty.   "

"**copy-pasting my reply from the other thread over to here:**

Well first of all, a mage would first have to break out of the Circle in order to attempt the journey to Tevinter, which is daunting enough. No one is going to let them go willingly. Let's say they take advantage of a day trip out or something and manage to go on the run- even if they manage to escape there's then the issue of phylacteries. The templars can use phylacteries to track you down: they are physically stronger (probably used to travelling long distances, which a mage wouldn't be), they outnumber their escapees, and a mage can never ever shake them off. All they have to do is look at this vial of your blood and do whatever templar-thing they do, and they know what direction to head in. 

So, it's likely that they will catch up with you pretty quickly, and Tevinter is a long way away. This is a total guess, but it would probably take weeks or months to reach the Imperium. It wouldn't surprise me if a mage ran out of food and clean water pretty quickly, or got caught in a storm or the cold and got sick, or was set upon by a mob who recognised the robes and, having been indoctrinated against mages their whole lives, responded with violence. In short: very small chance of escaping the Templars. They're an elite force in Thedas. They might just end up killing you, as happens to some mages who try to break out. I imagine that the prospect of the above is enough to dissuade many mages who are thinking of breaking out from doing so. Nearly all mages in the Circle have been there from a young age, so they're not exactly savvy when it comes to faring on their own.

As for Tevinter, plenty of mages don't like it. It's a corrupt, slavery-endorsing crumbling nation ruled over by the *elite* of mage society. Simply being a mage doesn't guarantee you a good place or rank. There's no guarantee you will be treated well. And with no family or connections, a Southern mage could easily fall prey to someone's schemes. An example of a mage who dealt with that:  [SPOILER ""Paying the Ferryman""](#s ""Calpernia is terrified of being sent to a Circle in case she ends up being used for someone's blood magic."")

One last thing because this is getting rather too long. A lot of mages are in favour of reforming the current situation. They want change. They don't want to leave home, they just want to be better treated. "

"I agree in theory with this, but in practice, 7/10 times I'd like them to stack and pull.
  
I rarely play carry, but get frustrated when my supports don't try to pull and help with creep equilibrium. The last time, I had an IO who I asked to pull the lane repeatedly, because it was trending towards their tower, and kept giving them a few free last hits, yet all he did was stack a camp that I wasn't anywhere near ready to take. The Io either babysat me in a lane where harassment was very minimal, and sapped experience, or stacked the camp I couldn't take, which ended up being sniped anyway.
  
As a support though, I thank you. I hadn't really thought about the single camp pull being used to push towers, and not just being a shitty practice. I hate how after I say I'm going to pull, after stacking the camp, go and pull, and my carry doesn't know what to do when the creep comes towards him. The other heroes he can deal with, because he knows those are a threat. But because the creep is normally not a lot of damage, he tends to believe he can tank all the hits, loses at least a quarter of his health to creep, then lets the tower tank it. The frustration I feel..."

"No problem!  You'll find out quickly (most likely) that the majority of keepers have this harmful ""more food is better"" ideal regarding their snakes, generally it's best to go with a more conservative feeding no matter the species.  This allows them to utilize more of the nutrients in their food and allows them to grow at a slower, healthier rate.  It should still be above the growth rate they'd have in the wild, as they have a constant food source, but should be closer to that sort of growth as their entire biology is suited for times of famine.  So, reaching a healthy medium is best imo. :)

Partly because a lot of this you won't find on Google (because it's hardly discussed), and partly because I know how important it is to get current feedback on actual owners.  Some things that you'll find on Google, for any species, can be outdated and you may not know it."

&gt;This is going to be controversial as hell, but I'll give it a go;

What you've taught me in that entire post is that you can't disagree with me without making it sound hostile and trying to start an argument despite me saying *in my first sentence* that this could be a controversial subject to talk about. So thanks for that. I love it when being optimistic about something gets me into an argument. /s

Now then.

&gt;None of anyone's business 

Says who? Why should someone like him go around on the internet and national TV telling people how to live their lives only to cheat on their own spouse? Surely that's millions of peoples' business since he was feeding everyone lies?

&gt;This should be between the people involved in the relationships, not for the voyeuristic pleasure of a bunch of people on the internet

Yes, sometimes. But when you go to a website and pay money to cheat on someone without a valid reason other than sex, you deserve to be humiliated. It's your fault. It's not exactly right to leak all that information, but at least some people aren't living lies any more. 

&gt;This could have been dealt with in a manner far less damaging to people who are being fucked over here.

Nope. They tried that and the site refused. The hackers then went ahead with a small hack to demonstrate. The CEO didn't give a fuck and called it all fake and kept on scamming people saying they were secure, now we're here.

Please tell me you understand the word controversial? And, if you do, I think that makes your whole argument worse.

Like Quick_Hide, my well to do parents hated buying me clothes and other necessities. Medical and dental care was infrequent at best. It's not about the money for an N, it's about never doing anything that doesn't directly benefit themselves. 

I think my classmates at my fancy high school thought my family was poor. I wasn't allowed to have friends over without a 24 hour warning and explicit permission, so I usually didn't bother. My wealthy school friends were really surprised when they picked me up for Prom. My parents house was worth about $2 million in today's money."

The main issue is that American ISPs are awful and don't care about their customers. Everyone across the nation would see significant differences if ISPs could simply pull their heads out of their greedy pockets. Cables are also in dire need of being upgraded.
"There's a novel idea, actually talking to someone."
"Keep in mind that we don't just hand out visas to anybody. Emigrating is actually a very difficult process, and though we are one of the more permissive countries, most countries won't even consider you, no matter who you are, unless you have some heritage in the country. Some even DNA fest you to confirm this (e.g. Japan).

We also test for many diseases and demand proof of medical history. If anyone in your family has anything our government could possibly have to pay for once you get here, you will be denied.

Your best bet is probably a work visa. That is, a real work visa, as a TN visa (work visa ""lite"") will not cover your family. Keep in mind that an employer-sponsored visa may be easier to get, but the minute you stop working for that employer, you have to leave the country. Do you really want that hanging over your head?

Americans always think it's so easy to just pick up and leave whenever they get pissed off at their government, but the reality is that unless you're a very compelling candidate, there's at least a 90% chance that we're not going to take you.

Also, the average house price in Toronto is around $1.15 million. Have fun with that!"

"I think that no matter how large of a run they do, the connotation of the ""Yeezy"" brand carries too much hype and popularity to make it that widely available. The few that can buy them will buy them, they will sell out and be flipped for $700+ just because they are Yeezys. Yes the shoes look great, but would you still be as attracted to the shoe if it didn't have Kanye's name on it, if it didn't have this larger than life hype behind it? Plus, I feel like there has to be some price threshold where the shoe's design and construction suffer based on how inexpensive they become. Just my (possibly more than) two cents."

"Due to my CP, getting on a scale is an inaccurate pain in the ass. My closest doctor's office doesn't have a wheelchair accessible scale. With my sister's help, we figured that our scale could have a margin of error of MAYBE +/- 5 to 7 depending on how I lean on a grab bar. When I was on the scale 17 days ago, about a week after I started complete strict calorie counting, it said 215. I figured that I need to wait about 5 weeks to check again in order to see a meaningful difference with the margin of error. I'm getting comments about my face thinning, and I woke up and noticed delightfully that my stomach is no longer level with my big boobs, having shrunk a bit. Intellectually, I know I'm losing weight. I know the number doesn't matter and shouldn't matter at this time.

But resisting the urge to get on the scale is REALLY FRIGGIN' HARD. I care more about the number than I know I should, and it's irritating.

On the plus side, I bought myself a Fitbit Go, and despite the cracks about the cripple using a Fitbit (it sounds harsh, but it's all in good fun with my family and friends, they're mostly extremely supportive), I have gotten 5000 steps for 6 days straight. I'm trying to train my stupid scumbag brain to care less about THAT number and focus on the number 5000. :)"

"One of my supervisors from the call centre I worked at stayed long enough to get retraining as a phone tech when the place closed.

I was working in a trade that involves some telephony, he turned up to work on the phone system. He had to connect phone lines to our equipment; I had run clearly marked wires back from our equipment to the demarc. Because he was still such a colossal idiot, he thought they were phone lines run in from the street, despite ample evidence to the contrary, and wondered why there was no dial tone.

Talk about a dim bulb. There were multiple lines that were clearly run to the blocks, if you know what a tel room looks like, you know you'd be putting your linesman's handset on and identifying the lines if they weren't labelled.

He cut my wires first, so short that there was not an inch to spare. I took great pleasure in telling my former supervisor he'd be pulling new ones while I watched if he couldn't make it work."

"The big problem with treating 'trans' as a holy cow is that it forces you to forget that Gender Dysphoria is the primary symptom of several different neurological and genetic disorders.

"I honestly think you are overestimating the complexity of the game. Like I said there are lots of weird quirks but the game really isn't that intense. If the average person wanted to buckle down and learn everything they needed to know, as long as they had the money to get all the cards they could probably do it all within a month. Like you mentioned, there are tons of hearthstone science and trump teaching videos out there to help. Are they going to be playing high level tournaments like this guy? No. He had an extensive background in MTG and high level poker tournaments. This is also what probably helped him get into the team he is on now and not necessarily his hearthstone skill. "

I've seen girls use this as an excuse to cut the date short (which is not subtle and totally insulting) and even if its not an excuse its still a little rude because a good date goes long and that behaviour isn't congruent to a good date. I always give my dates long enough periods of time to fold out well and if they don't than it means I have a free night. I think this is a good courtesy to have with anyone and its something you'll be happy you did when the dates goes well. 



I by no means expect my date to clear her whole night or to clear my whole night but if you agreed to go out with someone than you should give them enough time to be polite."

"In the area I grew up in it was very small and tight knit. Maybe 4 English speaking congs. total. My dad actually stepped down as an elder, but the rumor mill has a different story, and I think he knew that was going to happen, sadly. What I kept hearing from the idiot kids I grew up with was that he was deleted, I was there, I  heard the announcement and I certainly didn't appreciate the lies I was being told by my ""friends"". So naturally being the baby of my family I took on the role of the clown and just tried to keep things humorous and light through all that difficult shit. But I know the real story and the elders in my cong. did too and some were actually slightly encouraging, whereas others liked to perpetuate or rather not squelch the lies that were spreading. Gossip became a regular subject in local needs talks at nearly every cong. in the area.

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.

People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.

The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.

Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.

And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true          shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.

Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.

So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.

You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.

This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.

So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like ~~LeBron James~~ The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?

"I don't have a problem with the intel bundle and not just because vulcan harassers are one of the banes of my existence. While I understand why people are upset because it creates the impression of pay to win, it is at most only pay to win for a short period of time. Daybreak needs to make money in order to continue supporting their games, and if subscriptions, cosmetics, and the ability to use BC instead of certs isn't working, then things like the advanced intel bundle are perfectly reasonable. As long as the pay wall is short, no more than a month or 2, I have no problems with it and I have yet to pay; I will when I free up funds.

&gt; Please watch out my Flower wife.  I

to you image having seen you at work).  Their will/desire to have sex with

"Had one for my son, after the first time when he ran away up the street next to a busy road, we took it out every time, gave him a chance every time, and used it pretty much every time when he'd make a mad dash for the nearest potential danger for a couple of weeks. He got the hang of it pretty quick though! 

My 18 month old is determined to open every door she ever finds. Have to lock ourselves in at my sisters house because she can reach the handle. At my sons birthday party she tried to escape. She will climb up to windows, she's fucking baby Houdini. So yeah, backpacks back out and I would definitely recommend! "
"No one disregards the gravitas of the situation. I would be pissing myself if a grizzly charged me. But I've also been shooting for most of my life and I've seen how big they are. Within 50 feet the center of mass would be hard to miss for anyone with just mediocre accuracy(i.e. in they have spent several hours practicing and are familiar with their gun), and you have 16 tries. That is a lot of room for error. 

The point is that a glock 20 is a very good choice for self defense against large wildlife; not that we think being charged by a grizzly is a situation to be taken lightly. What I'd be most scared of is fumbling the gun getting it out of the holster.  Once the gun is out though, yes I am confident that I can hit a bear within 20-30 yards.

"Those are the most likely teams to go from Europe and also my hopes because of various reasons.

3.And Origen because they look like the best team other than H2k,FNC and they have familiar faces in the likes of xPeke,sOAZ,Mithy and Amazing.All of them proven as good players and veterans.

I'd take ROCCAT over Origen,if they can beat them in the Gauntlet though."

My objection is the money. I don't think we need this jet any more than we need 11 carriers, or ~~32~~ three new destroyers, or... etc. etc. The acquisitions process has been deteriorating for decades, and the F-35 is simply the most hyperbolic example of it; it could have been any program, really, but it just happened to be this one. 

I'm sure the jet is *really* cool, and has some really mind-blowing capabilities, just like the McLaren P1 can do things I could only dream of in my now-ancient Pontiac Grand Prix. Thing is, I can't afford either of them."

First off, you would need prior knowledge of how to optimize a mage build and know where to get the items and spells you need, then you'd have to slog through hours of farming. Second, you can only respec a few times per playthrough since Soul Vessels are so rare, it's not like you can just go back and forth switching builds to match any situation like a loadout or something.

"I remember every Thanksgiving, my cousins and I would play Mario Brothers. They lived in a different state and we use to be really close and would play together whenever we got together over the holidays. We'd playfully fight over who would be who and get as far as we could before it was time to eat. Then we'd stumble back into the room, bellies full, and pick up the controllers until it was time for them to leave. It really was a tradition, just like when we would all play softball over Memorial Day cookout or make cookies for Christmas. Thanksgiving is one of my favorite holidays and playing Mario is so entwined with those memories that years later, when we were both grown and together for the holidays, we would talk about all those times we would play together and how we wished we still had the system. I really miss that. We're not so close anymore, both of us having different lives, but I always remember being kids and playing together :)

"Give it to me because I am Veofratus, murder of hapless guardians.

One faithful day as I was running my daily quartz crystal farm path in Dry Top (one that involves going up towards the summit of Zephyr's Ascent, I discovered my horrible talent.


For my farming runs, I run a D/D zerker thief because of the unique stealth and agility expediting my runs - this means of course, I can two-shot most non-veteran PvE targets. A random guardian comrade was assisting me in clearing Dust Mites from the mountain top (partially farming them because they have a decent chance of farming charged lodestones). In our forty seconds of fighting side by side, we developed a camaraderie - even a brotherhood. Then, it happened.


The final dust mite to be slain. My guardian comrade leapt using Leap of Faith, and simultaneously I smited the dust mite with my one-shot combo. Mid-leap, my guardian friend lost his target - for I slew it before he could reach it, thus, he continued his leap...right off the cliff side, into his doom.


Since then, I have developed an insatiable bloodlust - a bloodlust to kill any dust mite on that fated ledge that a greatsword guardian may be targeting, for any semblance of a chance to hear the scream of another hapless victim. It consumes me everyday. Everyday, I lose more of my humanity. Soon, I shall ascend to the apex of my kind - soon I will not be a thief of petty ectoplasms or stunning maces, but a thief of waypoint costs."

So IF I did get it right, and IF it applies to moving to a newer version of DirectX, it's probably not going to be worth doing.

&gt;And SPC is not roughly equal to SSJ2 Gohan. Gohan beat him with 50% of his strength. 

I pulled this from the wiki ""Also in his Super Perfect form, Cell seems to be comparable in strength to Super Saiyan 2 Teen Gohan""  Something else to note, Gohan may have been at roughly half strength, but the entire rest of the remaining Z fighters, to include a significantly improved Super Vegeta, were also throwing ki blasts at Cell. Had Vegeta not intervened, Cell would have won. You also have to understand Cell's personality a bit. Even at Imperfect he's arrogant and only grew more so each time he transformed. By the time he hit Super Perfect, he was even more arrogant than Frieza was in his final form. Cell was not taking Gohan seriously when he engaged in the Kamehameha fight.

&gt;And he can't exactly ""regen at any point"" as his regen is still ki based. If he runs out of ki, he can't regen. 

Are you basing this off of Piccolo's regen? If so then you can't really compare the two. For example, Piccolo stated multiple times over the course of both anime and Manga that he could not regenerate his head, whereas Cell demonstrates doing just that. Twice.

"You know, I've never tried RIT color remover at all, much less on nylon. You're probably right to avoid bleach.

I actually did blue iDye Poly on a poly/nylon blend dress that was originally cream colored. Didn't need any color remover, just OxyClean to get out the spots and the blue came out even. I'm thinking back to this project and I think the poly took the dye a little better than the nylon, so you might need to cook that sucker for a long time. But I also know iDye Poly is popular for dying discs for frisbee golf, and plastic must need some serious dye, so that gives me hope for your nylon.

I guess maybe give the color remover a shot? I think iDye makes one too but I've never tried either."

Lately I have been severely depressed. I'm stuck in dead end job for 5 years now working part time because I had school full time. I've been trying to find a job with no avail. I get some good leads but end up going nowhere. I feel so beaten up emotionally over the past 2 years that...i don't know what to do or make something of myself. I've always put others ahead of myself. I've only tried to make others happy that I don't know how to make myself happy anymore.

"Fair enough, VAT is nothing to do with the argument as it really is a separate set of transactions.

&gt; They haven't paid what is truly owed in corporation tax through dodgy bookkeeping.

Matter of opinion.  Can you prove ""dodgy bookkeeping"" ?

They haven't paid what you believe is truly owed in corporation tax because factors brought their tax liability down.  You know that a portion of Starbucks' outlets run at a loss? Large corporations keep unprofitable stores running as 'loss leaders'.  These losses rightly should reduce tax due.  

Capital allowances, tax losses, writing off bad debts owed inward.  There are loads of factors that can bring a company's tax liability down.

So, I agree it doesn't matter whether the input is small or large.  (Although I suspect the majority of angry people are angry at the small input more than anything else).  But, I do not believe Starbucks have acted illegally or broken any rules or laws.  They have operated their business and at the the end of the year their profits have been small.

(Bear in mind, company profits brings in corporation tax.  If Directors of the company take a massive salary this will make profits appear to be small.  But, those massive salaries are subject to income tax on the persons.  Income tax is generally set higher than corporation tax (at least in the UK), thus it's swing and roundabouts at a 'contributing to the government tax coffers' level).

My point is this.  It doesn't matter what ""type"" of tax you label it as.  The tax revenue still reaches the inland revenue regardless.  It might have a different label, such as income tax or VAT, but it still gets there and it's still proportional to the sales of a corporation.

If a corporation pays very little corporation tax you normally find the shareholder and directors paid a large amount in income tax.  And vice versa.  Simplified example of course.

The general rationale behind the tax system is that single things are not taxed over and over again.

"I guess I see it both ways but if gentrification is just forcing out poor people for the sake of the wealthier, then all you're doing is making elitist areas and driving the less fortunate into more dire circumstances.  Sometimes being further away means lack of access to public transit, loss of jobs, etc.  I just am not able to justify the ""necessary"" in that evil without first thinking we should try to work with families that have been in these areas and are otherwise uprooted and displaced.

I think I also disagree with your use of ""improve their neighborhoods"".  Moving white people into previously poorer areas and throwing in some bars and some new restaurants (to me) isn't necessarily improving an area.  Areas can have solid backbones built by the families and communities in these areas, but all the developers see are $$$.

I definitely see it both ways though and see that some of these super crappy areas aren't fixing themselves, aren't safe places to go, and without injections of money and removal of certain people in favor of others, they will continue to stay in the same crappy states."

Does this sound like a fair deal to you guys? A family member thinks that $2000 is too much for a 1980, but I dont expect to pay the asking price and that seems about right for the bike to me. Also, people seem to think it won't be a very good bike for long trips because of the age (reliability).

LolNo.
"&gt; Hey, no need to assume I'm ignorant now.

Hey, we’re *all* ignorant.  Don’t worry about that.  I’m sure I’m ignorant about a *lot* of things that you’re more knowledgeable about.  Not game bred American Pit Bull Terriers, however.  I know a *loooot* about them, and I know a lot about how maligned the breed is and how misrepresented they are.  Why?  Because I care about the breed very much.  It’s just unfortunate that, again, too many people have not bred them properly and society ends up with many people-aggressive APBTs.  That’s the LAST thing you want in an animal that is *that* powerful, naturally aggressive, and strong.  I’m all for culling people-aggressive APBTs.  However, many *aren’t* people-aggressive, and most people don’t understand that it’s their specific breeding to NOT be people-aggressive that got them that way…and why were they bred to not be people-aggressive? because as they showed how formidable they were as dog fighters, the breeders understood just how detrimental it would be for *that* particular type of dog to attack a human being.

The point here is that unless you understand and appreciate their value as a pit dog, you won’t appreciate how important it is to make sure that they DON’T become people-aggressive.  Since most people don’t understand the former, they end up with too many of the latter, unfortunately.

&gt; Where we (seem to) differ is all this factual information your talking about here being justification for (or not) modern dog fighting.

I’m not necessarily justifying dog fighting one way or the other.  I’m more *accounting* for it and detailing its history and how/why it came about is all.

&gt; Though you seem to tip toe around it.

Na.  Not tip toeing at all.  Just letting you know that I understand the dogs and appreciate many of their qualities, AND I also know that you simply can’t appreciate those qualities separate and independent from what it was that *gave* them those qualities.

The ideal APBTs have the best combination of strength, speed, and formidability with calmness, coolness, relaxation, and a completely unflappable nature under pressure.

I love those qualities…*you* love those qualities…*many* people love those qualities.

What you and many people don’t understand, however, is that they got those qualities specifically as a result of their being bred as very people-docile *pit* fighters.

&gt; You 'seem' to be implying that all this factual information you are giving is justification for continuing to have dogs hurt each other for the entertainment of men.

Nope.  If pit dog fighting stopped tomorrow and the breed went away, never to be seen ever again, I wouldn’t bat an eyelash over it.  However, the fact of the matter is that human beings DO want and DO appreciate courage and formidability - in themselves and in others.  They/we value it to such an extent that we’ve bred a dog whose hallmark is deeply imbedded in those specific qualities of strength and courage.  You don’t GET those qualities without testing the “product” (in this case, the dogs themselves) under extreme conditions.  It’s as simple as that.

If you want a courageous dog that will fight, fight, fight and not give up, then history has shown that one of if not *the* best ways to get that is by matching that dog against its equal.  Again, this is something that humanity values in other breeds *as well as* itself.  After all, the fighting sports are the oldest and most popular sports in all of human history:  Boxing, wrestling, other martial arts, etc.

Game bred Pit Bulls are just the canine equivalent of the human mythic Hercules/Achilles archetype.

&gt; You can even understand that the dogs have been bred to 'enjoy' fighting. It'll still be wrong to do it.

So then again I say:  Don’t eat meat, don’t encourage the factory farming industry that is responsible for a MILLION times more death and harm and torture upon sentient life than Pit fighting ever has or will ever cause.  Don’t partake in any other type of activity that causes harm to any animal or sentient life.  I, by the way, actually AGREE with all these implications…and it is the very reason that I try as consciously as possible to practice [ahimsa](https://www.google.com/search?q=ahimsa&amp;oq=ahimsa&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.639j1j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=119&amp;ie=UTF-8) in my life.  It is the reason I haven’t eaten meat in over 11 years.  It is the reason I stay away from wearing leather products.  Etc, etc…

That being said, I have also been a fighter for over 23 years.  I have competed professionally as a pugilist, and have trained and traded *many* blows with some of the best practitioners that never literally ever competed in the activity.  As such, I fully understand and appreciate how a combatant - whether human or canine - can engage in a *very* difficult activity (one that can and has at times resulted in death to both humans and canine participants), and yet the participants enjoy it, continue engaging in it, and simply keep coming back for more and more.

Ultimately, what’s *really* wrong with the dynamic we’re talking about is forcing any animal (human or otherwise) to engage in an activity AGAINST THEIR WILL.  I feel THAT is wrong.  This is why I feel it is *very* cruel indeed to pit a game-bred APBT against *any other* type of canine that wasn’t bred to be a pit fighter themselves.  It is cruel to the *other* dog, because they will soon NOT want to continue happily engaging in the activity.  A game-bred APBT was *created* to enjoy and love combat - sometimes more than life itself.  This is simply a fact.

SHOULD they have been bred to fight?  Perhaps not.  However, the ones that *have* been bred that way and that are put through a proper “keep” (i.e. a training camp in preparation for a fight, similar to a human fighter in preparation for a fight) often want very little else other than to A) play with people, and B) engage in combat with another dog.  Again, that’s just the way they were bred.

I am glad that - agreeing or disagreeing - the dialogue here has ultimately been able to become decently amicable, as it is the way that I much prefer to communicate.

Cheers,"

"&gt; From Scott: Here's a direct quote from the NRC report summaries: ""The two main options for responding to the risks of climate change involve mitigation—reducing and eventually eliminating human-caused emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases (GHGs)—and adaptation—reducing the vulnerability of human and natural systems to changes in climate."" Limiting future carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere is challenging; there is no single approach that can do the job. That said, people are pursuing a number of options ranging from improved energy efficiency to use of renewable energy and carbon capture and sequestration from power plants. A good summary can be found in the National Climate Assessment chapter on mitigation: http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/response-strategies/mitigation At this point our best approach is probably to invest in a number of technologies and then determine over time which are having the best payoffs in terms of scalability and minimal environmental and social impacts.

From Scott: There are a number of carbon capture and sequestration projects underway from power plants and other industrial point sources. A team at MIT has a relatively up to date database:
https://sequestration.mit.edu/tools/projects/index.html
Direct air capture from the atmosphere has also been proposed and is being worked in the lab and research scale. There are some energy efficiency reasons to favor larger point-source carbon capture but there are also strong proponents for a more distributed, smaller-scale direct air capture. At this point with large (and growing) human CO2 emissions to the atmosphere, it makes little difference whether one reduces emissions by carbon capture or removes CO2 from the atmosphere by direct air capture. Both approaches (and others) need to be investigated."

"I don't live there and haven't visited in over a decade, so I can't really claim to have a perspective on it. However as an outsider, I'm forever seeing discussions about one thing side tracked by a 'debate' on race, often when it appears not to be relevant (again just my perspective as an outsider). Then as soon as that happens entrenched views come out and people stop listening to each other.

So like in the case with the article, we're trying to talk about dynastic wealth and class prejudice (class prejudice being very relevant to me as a British person). Of course in America non Anglo-Saxon people have historically fared worse on average.

 But holding this issue of class prejudice up as solely a racial issue seems like false equivalence to me? To me it seems like the best thing young people in America could do is attempt not to inherit their parent's prejudice (and that applies to people of all colours). Let's face it, people under the age of 30 are doing pretty shit comparatively throughout the Western world. Squabbling about who's great great grandfather did what to whom is fairly irrelevant to our current problems.

I will agree (for the most part) that the sequels didn't hold up to the first. Personally, I thought the second one was an outstanding continuation of the first. It stayed in the building and really fleshed out what happened while giving us something new in the process. The third felt like a standard ""infected"" movie with a couple of bright spots. The fourth, in spite of immediately following the events of the second was, I felt, a missed opportunity. Putting everybody on a boat just felt kinda cheap to me.

"A few patches ago I found out that if you mess around with the clipping settings you can get iRacing/rFactor-like FFB. It obviously won't be as good, but it'll have the same general feeling as those games where the feedback is very loose and you only really feel bounces and not much of the passive self aligning torque.

I haven't tested this recently so it's hard to say if it will work or what you need to adapt to make it work. I suspect you should start with the default preset and work from there. Based on when I wrote it, it seems to have been around 1.4 when they redid the FFB with what is now the new default setting.

&gt;However, after hours of experimenting I finally stumbled across settings that felt good enough. I turned tire force down to 80, but raised the Soft Clip (Half) to 5.50, and the Soft Clip (Full) to 5.0. This made a humongous difference and with the default FFB files I was able to get something that felt at least as good as it did before, if not better.

I remember after I wrote that I adjusted the values slightly, but I can't remember which one and in which direction."
"Friley's beds aren't lofted for two combining reasons: First, there's no standard room size or shape in Friley; practically every third room has a different shape or arrangement to it. Second, the commercially-available lofted furniture that the Department of Residence *could* purchase is too bulky for many of the rooms in Friley, especially because those rooms are often oddly-shaped. If they bought just one model of loft (as would make sense from a facility-management perspective), they would be a poor solution for many rooms. If they custom-selected different models for every room, they'd have 50 different models to track and maintain and replace, which is absurd. So they just leave you to provide your own loft, which means they don't have to raise the cost of Friley rooms to account for the loft purchases and maintenance, which means you pay less AND you can still loft your bed using a lumber kit you buy yourself, and thus own and can modify.

How fast are you running your 2-mile right now?  At 230 I remember speed work being doable but the risk to the shins and achilles was a little scary, at least for me.  My achilles is my weakest part but my shins never hurt now. 

I'm not a coach or anything and I'm not that fast, but I am training for a 100 right now.  Aside from the injury it looks like you might be on a similar path so PM me if you want more specific advice.  It's been about 7 years since I really started running seriously and it is definitely something to build on.  Just because that 7 days in a row feels great while you're doing it you have to watch what's happening on over the next week or two.

&gt; Guild Wars 2: Heart of Thorns is out at some stage before the end of this year, and a host of changes are set to come to ArenaNet's MMO when it launches.

&gt;We've detailed the upcoming Specialisations feature, which enables each character Profession to use a new weapon type and gain access to new abilities, but the Mastery System has been much more mysterious. Until now.
  
&gt;A demo shown off by the developer reveals when Heart of Thorns launches it'll do so with seven Mastery Lines. Three of these will be acquired in the areas already available in the game today, which ArenaNet is calling ""Central Tyria"", while the other four can be found in the Heart of Maguuma. Once you hit level 80, any experience earned will go towards individual Masteries, which can be unlocked using Mastery Points once enough XP is accrued.

&gt;Of the Central Tyria lines, each one has a clear role to fill. The Fractal Attunement Mastery grants access to additional dailies, new infusions, and instance-specific buff items or challenge modes, while The Legendary Precursor Crafting Mastery exists to make crafting your very own Legendary Weapon that much easier. On that note, ArenaNet confirmed three new Legendary weapons would be added to Guild Wars 2 when Heart of Thorns launches, with more following as the story develops.

&gt;My personal favourite of the old lines, however, is Pact Commander Mastery. This focuses on mentoring new players, and enables you to have a special icon over your head or in chat to indicate you're happy to help others. Continuing along this path will also unlock the ability to revive allies faster based on how many levels lower than you they are, and even two features all Guild Wars 2 fans have desperately been waiting for - auto-loot and speed boosts in cities.

&gt;The Heart of Maguuma Mastery Lines, meanwhile, have been spoken about before. Gliding makes its debut in Heart of Thorns, with possible Masteries including the ability to stealth while flying to avoid foes or accessing ley lines to boost across the map at high speed.

&gt;The other three - Itzel, Exalted and Nuhoch Lore - offer various bonuses ranging from the ability to summon challenging five-person bosses with unique loot tables to identifying mushrooms that, when eaten, reset all cooldowns.

&gt;ArenaNet was keen to emphasise more Mastery Lines will be added in future patches, but it estimates collecting all 39 Masteries coming at launch will likely take players as long as levelling from 1-80. The good news is the system is account-wide, meaning once they've been earned on one character you'll have them on them all.

&gt;We'll have much, much more on Guild Wars 2: Heart of Thorns in the coming weeks, so be sure to keep a close eye on IGN for all the latest news.  IGN Logo"
"1. Just start questing towards barrows gloves, which is 176 QP. Complete all F2P quests, all essential quests RFD and then any quests that give highest QP till 176. That will you get some pretty decent stats to start. 
2. I'd say go for 70+ in all stats, 70 def will give you barrows equipment which is really really nice. 
3. Look for quests with low skill reqs that give good exp rewards, it will save time grinding out early levels. Like the Knights sword for example gives you 30 smithung from level 1
4. Try nature running or start working in farming. Get yourself 32 farming and do herb runs with ranarr weeds. You should profit ~100k or so every herb run "

"other languages/cultures often have concepts similar to nostalgia, but applied to places/times that they didn't experience or which never existed at all. 

the notion of ""saudade"" in brazilian or ""sehnsucht"" in german are two examples with similar meanings that have connotations of melancholy/yearning that can be described as a longing for something that is perhaps unearthly or undefined (and therefore not directly experienced)

in welsh there is this great word ""hiraeth"" as well. i'll crib a definition i found: ""homesickness for a home you cannot return to anymore or a place, which never even existed. Connotations of sadness, yearning, profound nostalgia, and wistfulness are imbued into the state of hiraeth. Overall this beautiful, but painful longing is a an expression of an empty desire and grief over a past life or place. It is the ultimate signifier of a bond, which has ceased to exist.""

there are many more, i'm sure. i'm not saying that these concepts capture the elusive vapor feeling (which for me feels like nostalgia as well as something like being truly transported/time travel -- i feel like i'm INSIDE a slippery moment in my past, within my lifetime [b.1985], but that didn't actually exist); i'm just sayin, don't feel penned in by the constraints of the word nostalgia itself. there are many shades of experience that language can capture only awkwardly. 

also, back to english: there IS a word pre-nostalgia to describe anticipatory nostalgia for an undefined future -- pre-emptive longing for something that may possibly happen but is not likely, or a feeling of missing something before it's gone. so i would say the word nostalgia can easily be stretched to fit our purposes here without fear of contradiction :) 

p.s. maybe also check out hauntology if you haven't, the concepts overlap sometimes--- has its origins in the 1990s as a philosophical concept (""the priority of being and presence with the figure of the ghost as that which is neither present, nor absent, neither dead nor alive"") but in more recent years it's been used roughly in this way: ""a state in which late capitalist civilization, persisting after postmodernism's ""end of history,"" has become inundated by the perpetual pastiche and recycling of retro cultural and aesthetic forms, therefore obscuring the possibility of novelty in contemporary art, culture, and politics while producing a stagnant sense of historical disjunction"" 

sound familiar?

and around '06 there was a music scene that popped up (typified by the band Burial) that was called hauntological (probably just by the press i would wager)... think of the haunted ball scene in kubrick's the shining and you'll be pretty close to the vibe. crackly ghost-filled sounds that bring flickers of evocative musics of the past (and the nostalgia with it) and submerges them in an etheric interplay with modern sensibilities re: beats and production  -- really not too far off from vaporwave as an approach.

""At the heart of the musical micro-genre of hauntology is the sense of atemporality that underpins our present culture. Whether it’s musicians pastiching multiple vintage styles in a single track, the endless cycle of remakes and sequels in cinema, or historical genre mashups in pop literature, our future is looking increasingly like our past, which now looks like the future, which looks increasingly like the past, and so on.""

i'm also reminded of a feeling i get listening to old crackly vocal jazz records. i imagine the songs warbling out of a broken record player in war-torn europe (or, y'know, something), providing comfort, evoking a false memory of a feeling in the mind of someone in a simpler era than mine, someone else's nostalgia embedded in my own.

hakim bey: ""and yet there's a lot to be said for scratchy old 78s played over distant radio stations late at night -- a flash of illumination which seems to spark across all the levels of mediation &amp; achieve a paradoxical presence.""

what is that flash of illumination? the epiphany of collective memory? impossible nostalgia? the past and the present groping for each other, each looking for escape. each crackle and pop, the acoustics of recession that define old music.... each hiss, every evocation of the not-now takes the sounds from the pure abstraction of MUSIC and makes em a transdimensional transhistorical artifact, imbued with the long-gone conceits and impossible memories of another age, an invisible consciousness. we leave the now without entering the past or future; the crackles and pops remind us we can never go back... universal longing for... naivete? something else?

maybe that's why everyone has an extra-special relationship with whatever music they were listening to in early childhood. that music describes, to your mind, a time in which you had a magical worldview, ""a time when meadow, grove and stream/the earth and every common sight/did seem to me/appareled in celestial light/the glory and the freshness of a dream"" if i can super-pretentiously quote wordsworth of all people

similarly, i feel this sense of uncanniness about a lot of old video/film footage i see. it's immediately recognizable but at a step removed in subtle inarticulable ways beyond the obvious left-behind technologies and fashions. it's as if the human being itself has subtly morphed itself into something else and these old recorded forms are nowhere to be found anymore. which is exactly what actually happens as the elder generations die and their progeny live. to see the differences begin to accumulate ""in living color"" so to speak is something we've never been able to do before modern media

... trippy shit tho"

"Similar disappointment with the Gamer headset.

The angle mounts for the electrodes are held in place only by those saw-tooth click-clack hinges, no securing nut or anything.

Wish I'd seen The Brain Stimulator first - the hardware might look more like it belongs alongside the traditional nerd pocket protector, but the price is substantially better and they go with a headband and loose electrodes which I'm betting is not only more comfortable but actually higher quality than the foc.us solution.

Personally I'm all for not tiptoeing around things. Kids are more resilient than you give them credit for. And they are SO CURIOUS.

"Ok, so:

HPV is a virus that can cause cancer. There are many sub-types of HPV but let's keep it simple. Ignoring some less important types we can broadly split the viruses into two sub-types : those that cause cancer and those that cause genital warts.

1) These viruses can be found around the genital region and can be transmitted through sexual contact as well as oral sex. They can be transmitted even if you wear protection during sex because the virus is found all around the genitals and anus and obviously a condom doesn't cover all those bits! They can also be transmitted for example if you touched your genitals and then touched somebody else's.

2) I can't tell you much about symptoms - I'm more of an infectious disease person than a doctor. Perhaps someone else knows a bit more about that aspect but my understanding is that for cervical cancer irregular bleeding *may* be a symptom. However, there are other things that can cause irregular bleeding or prolonged bleeding during a period or after sex so it's not something you would necessarily be able to guess you have based on irregular/prolonged bleeding alone.This is why the pap test is important.

3) Yes, the vast majority will resolve by themselves (that's true for both the cancer causing types and the genital warts types). Most women will be infected in their lifetime and most women will clear it naturally, remember that the odds are in your favour so don't worry too much unless you have a reason to be worried. A minority percentage will not clear it naturally and over time this will progress to cancer or warts. Having warts does not mean you have cancer, the two are caused by separate viruses. I should add at this point that men can also get it and that HPV does not only cause cervical cancer. It can cause anal, vulval, oral, vaginal and penile cancer. 

4) The frequency at which pap smears are recommended varies by country but in the UK (for example) they recommend you get your first test at 25 and then every 3 years after that until you reach 50 years old. After that it's every 5 years. However, this varies. In other countries they might recommend you start as soon as you have your first sexual contact. 

Hope that helps a bit, let me know if anything didn't make sense."

Yeah all the settings are perfectly fine. OneTweak messed something up. On the OneTweak page, there's an uninstall bit that says: 

&gt; Delete [game install directory]/Data/SKSE/Plugins/OneTweak.dll then run SkyrimLauncher.exe and in graphics options make sure game is not running in windowed mode.

I actually did that, wiped it out of my Skyrim folder AND my Mod Organizer folder and it is STILL going borderless when I go through MO, but it is back to normal when I just launch SKSE manually :)

So I sort of know where to look now. I might just wipe MO and start over.

* What different notes look like and what time value they have (quarter notes, eight notes, also known as quavers etc.). It might not be worth the effort to learn reading the pitch of the notes and where they are on a piano until you actually have one in your possession.
* [Time signatures and how to read and understand them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_signature)
* [Key signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_signature)
* G-clef and F-clef (not really necessary to go deep into the theory of them yet, just know that they exist and what they look like)

But of course anything else that you would find interesting would be fine to learn about as well. It's just that you won't necessarily have much use for that knowledge when starting out.

"Dammit, that LOD transition on the left keeps this from being wallpaper worthy."
"I won't try to change your view because I think it's correct.

The first thing scientists are trying to do right now is to simulate the brain activity of very simple animals. As the computing power grows, they could simulate more and more complex brain activities, until consciousness emerges from simulated neural activity, just like it emerges from humans' neural activity.

That may take time (a couple decades maybe) but there is nothing too complex in the principle. It's a very brute force approach but there is no reason it wouldn't work.

Digitizing humans however seems way more complex, because you would have to make a perfect caption of an individual brain state (at a neural of maybe molecular level). The technology to get that seems pretty complex. But if we admit that's it doable, you just have to put that state into a computer simulation. So that requires at least a software to simulate a brain activity, which is exactly what was discussed earlier.

To summarize, first we manage to simulate the brain activity of a human being. And from that point, we would essentially have functional AI. Second of all, we may be able to initialise it with an actual human brain state to ""upload the consciousness"" of a human."

You're actually not just looking for mobile processing though, if you need internet and phone as well. Card processing can loosely be lumped into 4 types:

* In-person (fixed location)
* In-person (mobile)
* Internet/e-commerce
* Phone/Fax/Mail order

At this point, pretty much all processors (and there are tons) can handle any of those. Most have a mobile card swiper, if you want to take payments with a tablet or smartphone, they will have internet card acceptance options, etc. 

It partly comes down to how much of a factor price is. Something like Square might be fine for you if you fit a specific profile. It depends on how much you're going to process. But, there are also businesses that Square doesn't make sense for, because of their pricing model. 

If you're interested more in specifics, feel free to shoot me a PM and I'm happy to answer questions. (My company offers tools for businesses to find competitive credit card processing, which is why I know so much about this, but don't have any incentive to push you to a particular processor.)"

"I get that reaction in the US with my Nexus 6

Like I said, this method will always allow for an explicit definition of **ANY** array dimensions without the need to reshape.

In your example for a row or col vector, you can simply do:

    for i = (size(b,1):-1:1)
        a(1,i) = rand;
    end
    c = a*b;

Or for the *general case* which works for **any** size of `b` (including row/col vectors and scalars):

    for i = (size(b,2):-1:1)
        for j = (size(b,1):-1:1)
       a(i,j) = rand(1);
        end
    end
    c = a*b;

In every case where you know the dimensions that you need to allocate (in `zeros(n,m)` for example) this procedure will be valid. 

This will also work for higher dimensions matrices."

"If you want to look at these kinds of composite indices, it really depends on which one you pick; selection of factors and their relative weight matters a lot. For example, the [inequality-adjusted HDI](http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/table-3-inequality-adjusted-human-development-index) has the US on par with Eastern Europe and Greece.

And if you look at the [other chart in the context of something more than just BRICS countries](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2013/08/15/this-chart-might-make-you-feel-better-about-american-inequality/), you'll see that Tim Worstall cherry-picked that one and that in the developed world, the US looks more like Italy, while things look better for the poor in Denmark and Germany (and presumably the rest of the Nordic countries, Austria, and the Netherlands, too).

Plus, relative poverty in America typically results in social segregation, which is a big problem with being poor in the US: you grow up and live in poor (and often crime-ridden) neighborhoods, you're dependent on crappy public transport that no middle class person would ever use, you have to send your children to struggling inner schools: you're being set up to fail. Meanwhile, people in Germany or the Netherlands or Denmark have trouble wrapping their minds around concepts such as ""food deserts"" or ""trailer parks"", problems that are utterly alien to them [1].

Yes, but if the LM317 shuts down due to over-temperature or current limiting it will see the full input voltage. You could put a zener across it and lose the current limiting (and the zener would explode if you shorted the output).

[TI has an example of a better way to do it](http://www.ti.com/lit/an/snva583/snva583.pdf). The 5mA minimum current of the LM317 is pretty substantial at high voltages.

&gt; Is there any issue running 2 LM7805s in parallel on one tap, as long as I don't pull too much current?

Yes, there is some variance in the output voltage and the one with a higher output voltage will take 100% of the load."

Mulcair not answering questions in the biggest forum of the election is a giant obstruction to that ability.

Now learn the basics of critical thinking and maybe read the damn rules about downvoting while you're at it."

"I'm not trying to correct the dictionary, I'm trying to update it. “Interval” used to mean only “space between things”, and then people started using it to mean two-notes, and the dictionary was updated, or added to (years after people had been using the term in this way I’m sure.) Any professional linguist or lexicographer (and many music theorists) will tell you, unequivocally, that what they write and classify is subservient to usage, it's not the other way around, no matter how many people ""dedicate their life[s] work"" to coining and preserving terms. The only time one should coin a term is if there already exists no term already. And I can already hear you thinking: ""then why are you trying to stretch ""chord"" to include 2-tones played at the same time when there are already dictionary codified words you can use? Here's why: it's all about usage baby. I didn't stretch it, a million other people did. And again, I accept and honor all the things you've pointed out to me as facts, I’m sure you're very erudite in many areas I am deficient in, but it doesn't have to be a contest, that’s not how reality works. In reality, two ideas can exist at once, and atoms can be fused to make new molecules. Answer this: why can't the word ""chord"", which millions use in context with 2-note chords, be added to the definition? Why not? Seriously? Why does that bother you so much? Do you really want to tell every person you come across (excluding me) that uses the word ""incorrectly"" that they have been ""fooled"" and ""misinformed""? No you don't! No one does, no one wants to be that guy, except for a few purists who can't sell any of their own records and don’t know how peoples’ usage of words has changed on the street because they’ve locked themselves in their academic towers. Semantic drift happens, and this is why semantic drift happens: it just does, has for millennia. If my profs had failed me for answering 2 instead of 3 on a test, that's fine (though I probably would have known in that context to play by the rules, newly outdated). Consider the gosh darn Taylor Swift books a third of my students bring in to me all the time: every other page has the ""chords"" G5 or E5; they are presented exactly the same as all the other chords, and all my students think of them as chords and call them chords, even T-Swift calls it a ""G fahve Cho-ard."" And I'm not gonna waste their parents' money telling them they've been fooled and misinformed, and they must call these specific notes played simultaneously by another more precise term. I guarantee you in 50 years all your above definitions will have changed, or been added to, because the usage has changed, it really has, it's not a phase; it's not ""slang""; yesterday's slang is today's verbal class distinction (as you would learn in any historical linguistics class.) ""Power chords"" and ""5 chords"" has ruined it, and the pendulum is swinging, the virus is spreading, why try to stop it? You can still use the word “chord” to mean “three notes or more”, that hasn’t changed, what’s the big deal? Try to take a macro, centuries-out view of things. It’s not “triad or chord” “dyad or chord or doublestop” “7 chord or tetrad”, it’s both—both both both. Most of your criticisms have revolved around your refusal to conceptualize the concept of ""both"", and most of my criticisms have revolved around my not playing along the ""logic of dominance"" rules you are trying to play by. 

Two more examples:  I agree the word ""song"" used to mean only ""a sung melody"", but what do you think of the people of yesteryear who, like yourself, told all the people starting to use the word to mean the noises birds make, or the music a singer with accompaniment makes, or then maybe the singer took a break and the people called the little ditty the harpsichord player played to pass the time a ""song"", that they were wrong? Yes it’s more precisely called an instrumental, but why can’t people also call it a song if that’s what they’re going to do and if comprehension is preserved? (incidentally, I agree the Apple Ipod stuff is stupid, especially the new update, it’s horrible), but if it's going to happen, it’ll happen. Let it go and spend your time on something else. Next example of this is ""beat"". Everyone in the hip-hop world nowadays (and consequently now all of my students) uses the word ""beat"" synonymously with ""a composed rhythm"". I promise you won't find that definition yet in any dictionary, so don’t even go look. So who is wrong though, the dictionary or Dr. Dre., and the answer is: No one is wrong, that's just how it is. You can still use the word ""beat"" to mean steady-beat or tempo... Here's the thing: Have I ever in this whole two-day conversation called one of your definitions wrong? If I have, I only meant to say that it was incomplete, or possibly incomplete if I was searching for better terminology I was yet ignorant of.  I've spent the last twelve years since music college seeing firsthand how some of the things I learned weren't quite adequate or up to date any more to describe music usage--usage usage usage... Besides, you'll learn/comprehend and create far more in life if you try to focus on what people mean rather than on what they say, or worse “should be saying”. And that's sage advice for any theorist of words or music...

"So, I'm a substitute teacher with a teaching degree.

One thing I will say: don't ever, ever, EVER, try to grade students' papers. That is their real teacher's job. It is not your business or your job, at all. Teachers have their own individual grading systems and they don't want you messing with them.

You are there to deliver the material the teachers provided. If you don't understand the material, it's okay to tell the kids ""look, I don't understand questions X and Y, so if you don't get them then leave them blank and I will explain to your teacher that I did not understand them."" Don't criticize the questions, it's not your place. Just write a note that you didn't know how to respond to the kids' concerns, so you told them to skip those questions. That way the kids will not be blamed. 

It's okay to try to go over materials with the kids rather than just passing out the papers if you understand them, but at the same time, if you don't understand them, then what are you doing trying to teach them? 

Finally... I hate to break it to you, but the work you're giving kids as a sub is filler work. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the work that gets collected when I sub goes straight into the recycling, or at least is never graded. The hardest part of subbing for me is knowing I came into teaching to make a difference and I'm not actually making a difference at all. I'm a babysitter. I'm there to fulfill the school's legal obligation to have an adult in the room. 

That said... this message from your sister is coming from one biased source. It's possible she is just taking some criticisms she has heard and blowing them out of proportion in order to hurt you. If you truly want to improve as a sub, you need to ask the teachers you have subbed for regularly for feedback and see what kind of things they say that can help you. 

The sad reality of teaching is that staff rooms, etc. can be toxic places where people get talked about behind their backs. Just because some teachers don't like you as a sub doesn't mean all of them feel that way--a lot of the best teachers avoid the staff room anyway. 

Edit: oh and P.S., kids never like subs who try to do their jobs. They like subs who let them dick around and do nothing all day. So I wouldn't put too much weight on what the kids say, their standards differ from actual professional standards of what makes a good substitute. "

I can't really say with the little information you have given me.

If I felt I needed to be risk adverse at the time, I wouldn't. It would depend on how well my company was doing at the time, what sort of position it was and a dozen other things. And this is assuming the /100 score that you have given me to go off is the best I can gauge people, I think it's very simplistic.

We should all care what happens after we die, because the survival of the coming generations depends upon it.

"A quick reply which would have otherwise been buried underneath a comment supporting this article:


1) Transfers

If anything Rodgers has more control now over transfers, not less. Benteke has been a Rodgers target for 2 seasons and we just spent £30m on him. If the owners weren't confident in his spending ability would they be backing him up like that? Calling Joe Allen a transfer failure at £15m is only indicative of the extreme irrational dislike the author has for Rodgers in that he is willing to write off a perfectly decent squad player on perfectly decent wages merely for the fact Rodgers signed him. According to this Rodgers would have preferred Bertrand to Moreno. I like Moreno, but the case could definitely be made that Bertrand had a better season with Southampton than Moreno had with us, I certainly think he is the stronger defensively.

2) Ego

This section is completely unfounded. Author doesn't like his personality. Fair enough. Not a valid reason to criticise his managerial ability. Using quotes which fail to consider the context they were originally used in and ignore the context of last season prior to which we lost arguably the best striker in the world and had our second best striker ruled out through injury. The £100m quote in particular is unfair, fails to consider net spend, relative wage budgets of clubs, a whole host of complexities. Of course it's a bit silly of Rodgers to say it in the first place but shoving it in his face when our net spend was actually closer to £36m is plain stupid. Pinning poor team performances on something the manager said in the pre-match press conference is even more idiotic. It's a team game, guys.

3) Defence

 &gt;   Had Rodgers consistently started with Sakho and Manquillo as opposed to Lovren and Johnson, our defensive record would certainly have improved no matter how little or large.

Pure speculation. It's not a fair point to make from my perspective but who was the CB pairing on the last day of the season against Stoke? Sakho and Skrtel. Rodgers sees his players on a daily basis and is well within his rights to have preferred options, even if sometimes the fans don't see the reasons for that.

Also, paraphrasing:

 &gt;   Johnson got too much playing time, shouldn't have been near the pitch, but why did he not play the last game?!?!?!

Duh-doi.

4)

Umm.... Ok?

5) Man Management

Surprise surprise, people who were not in the manager's plans didn't get on with him very well. Also:

&gt;    It seems rather coincidental that since Rodgers’ arrival, many big names and influences within the team have departed. These include Reina, Agger, Carragher, Kuyt and most recently Steven Gerrard. The remaining influential characters are Kolo Toure and Lucas Leiva, who Rodgers has actually tried to get rid of in the past.

Reina was on a huge wage packet and had some pretty poor performances; Agger was unfortunately torn apart by injuries; Carragher retired and had always planned to, even pretty sure he admitted he regretted not staying another season; Kuyt left 2 days after Rodgers joined when Fenerbahce met his release clause; and let's be honest, Gerrard could no longer cope with the pace of the premier league game and wanted to play week in, week out, which Rodgers rightly couldn't provide him.

Also ignores the many players who have come out in praise of Rodgers man management, I'll just leave this here:

 &gt;   You go out feeling full of confidence and belief. His one-on-one management is the best I've known.

    Steven Gerrard on Rodgers' management.

Article also uses Mignolet as an example. One of the better pieces of man management Rodgers demonstrated last season was pulling Mignolet out of the firing line, giving him a bit of a spell out of the limelight and allowing him to find his confidence without the pressure of the media on him on a weekly basis.

To be honest this completely sums up the article:

"We usually do get great results from receivers in their second year (and not much as rookies). Rodgers did very well for a rookie splitting time, and as a TE in our system (he also performed better than Finley did at TE as a rookie), also he was greatly improved down the stretch last season and made those huge TD catches against Dallas &amp; New England. I think he's on track to have a great season, not necessarily going to show up huge in the numbers with how many weapons we have on offense (there are only ~60 TDs to go around passing), but he will be valuable this year."

I sometimes try to break kiosk PCs and hotels and banks. I'll press every key combination I know that could get be shell/gui access and sometimes it works.  A lot of devs have no idea about stuff like control-alt-esc or control-alt-backspace which is kinda sad. They know how to string together print, if, and for statements, so they must know everything about computers! Right?!

Thanks to their stupidity, I've gotten many free hotel printouts and free internet access with barely any effort.  I won't go into other fun I've had on hotel networks, but lets say they're all pretty terrible. Anything with schools or anything that uses union labor is going to be extra terrible. Pretty much no one gets security right unless there's a massive incentive to, so outside of certain industries, banks, etc its typically child's play for your average sysadmin, let alone any blackhat with a clue and 10 minutes to spare. That said, when I enter a secure environment its always a little impressive, I smile at the inside that someone is doing his job right instead of collecting a big salary and installing Reader and Ultron for clueless boomers.

Security is so bad everywhere its like being in a decades long war. Its just so terrible all the time that its hard to get upset at anything specifically. you just accept it and endlessly march towards the front."
Seriously. He's great at analyzing the game after the fact but critiquing the lore as literature is kind of silly.
"The game itself looks really fun. The first Crackdown was such a cool surprise, and really any superhero game that isn't terrible is always a continuing relief.

On the other hand, is anyone else struggling to watch any game trailers recently? If you really listen to the words they say, you realize that not only is it repetitive, its also largely the same words as used in the next similar genre video game trailer. Every time I hear the words ""any way you want"" I cringe. I know its marketing, and there is a certain level to be expected (and this trailer isn't the worst offender) but MAN you would think SOMEONE would come up with a better way to say ""lots of choices""."

"Honestly, if you love a store - even if their policy allows for it - returning over half of what you buy dollarwise (especially if it's in a condition where it's going to be damaged out) when you're spending that much begins to feel like it's going beyond just taking advantage of their generosity even if you won't lose your privileges so long as you have a receipt. Sephora is *really* great about giving out samples or giving you the ability to sample/test anything that you possibly can in store - get samples made up when you can, try applying lip products that you feel can be properly sanitized (and actually wearing them around if it's a new formula for you) and really research everything beforehand. 

I mean, I do all of that - and I do still end up with some returns... but I'd say I maybe return one in 10-20 products I buy at Sephora. I still spend *a lot* of money there, but I just aim to only buy things I know I love (largely because I *really* hate dealing with returns). Realistically, no one can tell you how to shop - and their policy allows you to do what you're doing with little consequences aside from possibly a stinkeye from some not-so-pleasant employees... but they're really a great store that set up to help you minimize the number of returns you need to make, take advantage of that if you can! It results in much fewer guilty feelings.  "

As an aside, I always thought it was a weird historical quirk that the leader of a ship is the Captain, and the *command*er is not in command.

"Another judge eventually did. His lawyer continued the case repeatedly in hopes that I would eventually fail to appear and he could get it dismissed.

"This is absolutely me, except I think I know what causes it for me, and that is simply boredom.

I was in the military and was assigned a job outside of my area of expertise, that was fine and I was ok for a while. But after a year or so I had mastered everything there was to know and was well recognized as an expert. At this point I started to really hate what I do and wanted to do anything else.

I deployed and it was great because it was so dynamic and challenging on a daily basis.

When I got back I was assigned a new job and within 6-7 months I was being sent out to teach other people how to do it. I had once again mastered what I had been assigned and the boredom and rage was back.

Now I am free and I go to school but its been about a year and I have maintained very good grades while being in my opinion under stimulated intellectually. So of course I am bored and searching for the next thing to challenge me.

I know one of the features of aspergers is extreme focus on a specific subject. For me that has often been my job. I can pick up anything and know it inside and out within a year or so. Once the unique problems become commonplace for me I cant be bothered to care anymore and I start to slack off and search for something new.

My moving several states in the last few years has separated me from the few people I would consider friends but I dont feel any loss. If I see them again or not isnt a big deal for me, likewise I dont talk with family or even make friends in my new place because I know there is a good chance I will leave again.

For me there is a bit of depression involved. I am very comfortable being alone but sometimes I think I would like someone to be there. Unfortunately my nonexistent social skills make that impossible. "

"[disclaimer -- I created a site to create and run flex leagues]

I recently created a site to run [flex leagues](http://www.racketlogger.com). It's effectively a competitor to the USTA flex leagues and Ultimate (UT). We took advice from people in /r/tennis as well as experienced UT and USTA flex league players. It's called [RacketLogger](http://www.racketlogger.com).

We tried to improve on some of the downsides of the others. One of the features is that anyone can start a new league (with friends, acquaintances, etc.), though technically this feature is not out yet, so I and another person can create a league, but it only takes a few clicks. For example I just created a [San Diego 4.5 flex league](http://www.racketlogger.com/leagues/san-diego-mens-singles-august-2015/register) just now if you want to get started :-)

We have some extra features, like you can create discount codes (e.g. I just created a 25% discount code ""reddit"" on this one), and the ability to see some small stats on how you do over the season, email notifications, the ability to follow some other league, add your racket stringing logs (this is how to the site started, hence the name).

We launched in February in the SF Bay Area and so far it has been well received. We have played 240 matches to date in a few leagues, from 3.0 to 4.5. Trying to make it attractive to higher level players too.

Looking to improve any area of it that you may hate or add things you need, so feel free to send feedback!"

"Worked as a research assistant with a guy. He had a cushy job. Set your own hours, work from home. Make $42.05 an hour. All you had to do was show up with your 1/3 of the project complete once a month. You could even drop it off and someone else would assemble it for you.

4 months in, he hadn't done anything, and just disappeared. Took the money and ran.

Myself and another guy got our contracts extended for 8 months to pick up his slack and complete the project without him.

"This is a possible outcome for sure, though certainly not his floor. Spiller could hit 60 passes and 150 touches. 

Being that he is not as effective on pass plays, isn't a great runner, and the Saints offense has regressed those touches will probably net him no more than 800 yards. Given that he is horrific in goal line situations, he likely won't have more than 3-4 TDs. 

60/800/4, which is being generous, is 164 fantasy points in PPR or RB18 last year. Exactly what I said, could be a low end RB2 in full PPR. 

That is his absolute ceiling IMO. And Spiller's floor is very low:

- He has never started more than 11 games in a season, because he is constantly injured. 

- He has been horrible on passing plays for the last two years. If he isn't productive on those plays, the Saints will find someone who is or will decrease their reliance on those plays. He was a complete drive stopper when used like this in Buffalo.

I notice that you patronizingly tell other commenters to go back and read what you wrote, so maybe you should re-read what I wrote instead of reading into it and assuming things that are not there.  In no way do I present as ""obviously jaded.""  Not to mention, the original poster of this story stated that the person who she had the interaction with was off his meds, and therefore he would be in an unstable frame of mind, which kind of negates pretty much your whole argument against me.

"&gt; I did try to kill my emotions when I was 14-16

Why? And how exactly would you accomplish this?

&gt; I tend to think ""is this feeling appropriated for this situation? How should I be feeling right now?"".

This is absolutely normal. I've also thought ""How should I be feeling right now?"". There is nothing wrong about this. I have trouble describing precisely what I am feeling, so this question may help me translate my feelings into words.

&gt; Am I 60% happy, 15% hyped, 15% surprised and 10% angry at the same time? How should I be feeling right now? Did I count it right?

But I don't really question myself if it is appropriate or not because it does not matter. I feel what I feel, if it is the right feeling for the moment or not will not change what I am feeling unless... suppose something makes you really angry but you think ""is this feeling appropriated for this situation?"" then it might be helpful to make you realize it is a case of a storm in a teacup. It is a valid question."

See, I'm really good at visualizing and I live almost in a constant state of half in, half out of my 'wonderland' so to speak so I'm very immersed and when they speak, it's like they're speaking to a mental me, or the me in the wonderland and not my physical form...

"I think that whether or not plants feel pain or not, and how to define that, is debatable. Which isn’t me saying you’re wrong, just that I’m not convinced of it. I don’t buy the “central nervous system” argument, it just seems too easy. All living things feel pain to 100% of their capacity for it. You might be a more sensitive individual than I am, yet I too will experience fear and pain to the extent I can, and it’s as horrible to me as your fear and pain is to you. Won’t a single-celled creature move away from an acid or other threat to its life? Does it not attempt to preserve itself with as much effort, given its limitations, as you or I would? 


I don’t think eating meat is merely a thrill pleasure – a desire for variety, perhaps (though maybe that’s what you mean by “thrill”). But don’t vegetarians also crave variety? I imagine you could live by eating apples which have already fallen from the tree and whichever other plans you deem to have the least capacity for pain, but your diet would be boring and you’d likely be unwilling to stick to it – so it’s a matter of degree. 


Two things to note in what I’ve said here:

""The Book of Mormon says, ""Priestcrafts are that men preach and set themselves up for a light unto the world, that they may get gain and praise of the world; but they seek not the Welfare of Zion…. But the laborer in Zion shall labor for Zion; for if they labor for money they shall perish"" (2 Ne. 26:29, 31). Inherent in this definition is the concern that Church leaders must labor to build Zion into the hearts of the people, and not for their personal aggrandizement or reward. When leaders ""make merchandise"" of men's souls (2 Pet. 2:3), they turn religion into a business, and pride, materialism, and unrighteous dominion follow.

"Any idea which position Haru does well in for mono-thunder? I don't think there's even room for him over all the other choices...

He seems pretty lackluster and I feel like he's only good for utility strikers that rely on stealing the ball back after a shot in the front line. I can see him synergising well with Ravian but not so much Blade since she benefits more from a crit totem.

He's a defender and has bonuses in the backline; but the lack of a GK support totem hurts and I don't see a reason to run him instead of a proper totem.

I was considering him for CM, but after trying it a bit, I don't see why I should even consider him over Eden (great positional buffs) or Jury (table flips) which are both easier to superb.

Unless there's something awesome about him (other than his light/thunder ace and art), I'm not exactly sure what he excels at.

"I've failed so many times i don't even remember the first. But the biggest: I've been evicted from my apartment. Twice. I work in the oil industry. In 2009 I lost my job. In 2010 I lost my girlfriend. Was homeless for a third time. Earlier this year I lost my job (I had three months notice it was coming though). I took out a $10,000 loan to [start a personal business] (http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/35uil1/fucked_up_a_big_stock_market_dream_not_dead_but/). That failed miserably and I lost it all in three months. Thanks to a friend I'm back to working where I was several years ago making 1/3 what I was making last year.

My wife doesn't quite get me which sucks. But I'm not afraid to fail and I can't stress that enough. Some could argue taking out a loan to trade stocks when you know you're losing your job was stupid. I saw it as a means to get away from a cyclical industry. But I was ill prepared. I now have a far more solid plan that will take some time to enact but that gives me plenty of time to solidify it even more.

You just can't be afraid to fail. When I left my current company to go contract I knew I was leaving behind job security in exchange for money. But the end game has and always been to get myself into a position to have more control over my financial future. And every time I fuck up it's another lesson learned. 

I see people who did things the ""normal"" way: college, career, wife, kids. That's not me. I dropped out of college. Had my son. Built a career learning programming and swing trading in my off time. Married a not-my-sons-mother. And I've yet to turn 40. 

I see those same people scared to try things because it's not conventional or too risky. Well, I'm not a daredevil. But I'll be damned if I go do my 8-5, come on to watch tv. I've got things to do. Places to be. And a better plan to get there than I did yesterday."

For anyone still looking to gauge their performance in the event, I'd amount the first form boss to an equivalent boss on Medium and boss in final form as an easy Hard mode. If you guys can't even touch the boss in 4-5 I'd recommend easy."

"did the detective get access to the chat logs from the site you had established your relationship on?  thats very crummy but there is more you can do.  you were in an abusive relationship, have you considered at least going to the local lgbt friendly place i recommended and talking to counsellors who have spoken to other people in your unique situation?  they can provide a little legal advice, i dont know if a civil lawsuit is an option ive been assuming you have been pursuing this as a criminal matter this whole time?  at least that way you can tell your friends ""yep ive seen a counsellor and guess what they have seen victims like me before and this is a legal matter affecting me psychologically, not a psychological matter affecting me legally"".  this really is a shitty justice system we give ourselves up to, and many people commit suicide because there is no justice and people feel like their reputations are ripped away from them, but i feel like you can own this and move forward and come out on top from this whole terrible experience from the little exchange we've had."
"The thing is I already sent a follow up email after I received this one already. It says: Thank you for your reply and it certainly arrived sooner than I expected.  I am very appreciative that I am still in consideration for a position with blah company. If it is decided to open a second position in the hometown office I would gladly fulfill the requisition. I would also like to be considered for a position in another region near hometown should it fit within blah companies hiring needs. Ultimately however, should your team decides to proceed with another candidate I would like to thank you for the opportunity. Meanwhile, if there is anything I could do to continue the process remotely please let me know.   

Should I just wait and be patient at this point or send another email since the discovery of the new job listing? I'm literally losing sleep over this. My industry is in demand but being at this office so close to my hometown would really work for me. "

"They replaced Halloween with Freakfest, they close off state street and charge admission, cops all over. They've been trying to replace Mifflin with other stuff, it's really not as big as it was a couple years ago. Again, cops cracking down. 

A couple years ago there were some stabbings at Mifflin involving people from out of town, not students, so they stepped up police presence. Which sucks for the actual students that out-of-towners from Chicago can't keep it together enough to not riot or stab anyone, but that's the way it is."

It was like every time I went into a Diablo game or even if i made one, i was boned and doomed to die. So I stopped playing online. It's not been fun for me. I still try but if I do I play with a friend to help keep frustration in check. My mistrust is so deep, I couldn't enjoy Destiny and really really wanted to... I do Lan parties. Some of my best times in gaming were Halo and Halo 2 parties we had. I want to play ESO but I just can't bring myself to do it. To me gaming is me time. I don't want to have to socialize too. I want to enjoy the game, not worry about dealing with others."
"I (exmo) had a hard time explaining this to my Mormon friend. It's like saying, oh what a sad world it would be if Santa isn't real. No flying reindeer? No north pole secret workshop? Who would want to live in a world where Santa isn't real?

It's really not such a big deal to those who never held the belief, or to those who have moved past it. It's just how the world is. A sunrise is still beautiful. Music continues to enchant. Life is not ""empty then and comfortless"" for people who don't believe in an afterlife."

"I want to agree, but like a couple of other loans I've seen us send players on, it just seems a bit off and there's usually a good reason for that in my experience. 

It's not hard to look at Ibe's performances this season, his age and say, yep, he could use the loan. Yet it's the older, more experienced Markovic getting sent to a league where even if he starts all the games (of which there are no guarantees) is no similarity/preparation for the Premier League. 
Didn't one of the promoted or mid-table sides have any need for him? Why was he getting chopped at half time when the whole side wasn't performing?

Also, we're in four competitions and we're going to need the players. One or two of Phil, Firmino, Lallana and Ibe get injured and the spot opens up straight away for him. Look at Lucas, one good game and all of a sudden Beskitas are saying the deal's off. Why did it get that close?
Instead we'll now have to do tactical gymnastics to get it all to work properly. 

Hopefully he has a good year and improves as a player. There are positives, but you have to say some of the things going on this last year or two have been perplexing at best. It's pretty hard to see what the long-term plan, or dare I say it, philosophy is."

The advantage here is the short duration lack of rest keeps you in the red, which is good, but it's not as mentally grating as doing 4-6m suffer-fests.  Also, the whole thing is over pretty quick, so it still fits into a time-crunched schedule.

Going vegetarian will at first probably be difficult, there will likely be cravings. But if you push through the first month or so you should be fine. If your girlfriend is vegetarian it'll likely be even easier for you. 

For me personally I come from a household that is pretty much always consuming meat and animal products and one day I just decided I'd had enough of the mistreatment of animals and didn't want to contribute to that anymore so I went completely cold turkey. 

Thankfully you've got the support of your girlfriend, I'm sure she'd be happy to help you out. Just make sure you're getting enough of everything you need. "

(Bell, AP, Charles, Lacy)

I'm going to put in 2 ideal teams through 5 rounds of drafting according to fantasy pros' ADP. Obviously everybody's personal strategy is different, this is just to compare the players you'll be looking at. 

currently:
J.Charles, A.Rodgers, T.Hilton, J.Randle, T.Kelce

potentially: 
O.Beckham, A.Rodgers, L.Miller, T.Kelce, G.Tate, C.Ivory

I personally like the second team a lot better, even with some guys I'm avoiding this year. (Kelce bc idk just am trusting my gut, and Rodgers simply bc my strategy is to typically avoid drafting QB's early)

I like the deal for you in terms of your draft options but the 2nd overall pick is definitely ""worth"" more than the last pick in the first round and a fifth rounder. 
if you could grab his much higher fourth rounder, and toss him maybe your 6th or 7th, I'd swing it!

"Just my two cents, but my professors have always stressed that the kind of problem solving you have to do requires you to make assumptions. Ideally the problem statement will tell you mole ratio or mass ratio specifically, but if they don't, then what? Obviously if it's real world you would ask, but if you can't ask you have to write your assumption(s). Just like when dealing with fluids when no one mentioned a temperature, just make a note: ""at room temperature,"" or the like. You could go by context in the problem, or when all else fails I would typically assume mass percent for solids or volume percent for fluids--it just seems like that's the most likely way either thing would be measured.

It's worth pointing out that you should always check a composition for 100%. If you don't have 100%, then that's another assumption to make. In this case I think /u/ThatBlackGhostbuster is right to suggest that hydrogen would make up the balance for a fuel mixture."

"Its a shame the game has turned into what it is today. It was a huge part of my childhood and like many said a great deal of its charm just came from the social aspect of it. Doing KPQ, meeting new people and making friends. 

Sadly the game is but a shell of its former self but really at this point its not really that big of a deal. I think I would feel pretty weird going back and playing it now as a 23 year old even if it was still the game it use to be. That being said I think we all made some good memories from the game and that in it self is something not too many games have done for me."

"Except after i've gotten AHOD and EWC on nearly every toon I still need to spend that couple million dil and 200+ million EC on a set of guns. So for that price I can go around slapping plasmonic leeches on my toons, bigger bang for my buck. 

and then after that I'd be better off making sure everyone has rep gear.

and then I'd be better off getting [eps] consoles 

And then i'd probbaly get more out of upgrading the iconian cores to UR

and then I could get them all into fleet t5-U or t6 ships. 

and then I could afford to buy ships for traits like supremacy, especially for the toons that would benefit most

So on. Epic guns don't come anywhere near close enough to being a cost effective upgrade. Unless you have a spectacular amount of EC and Dilithium, you will always have better things to buy than gold plated weapons. "

"The current situation is that the First World environment discourages people from having kids. Saying ""go have kids brah"" is ineffective because people respond to incentives, not to what authority figures say. There's currently a strong incentive for young men *and* women to further their educations and careers during prime baby-making years. Shortage of money and time adds to the reasons why First-World young adults don't have kids.

An anarcho-communist society could have fertility rates above replacement and not oppress women. The way this would happen is that it basically removes the cutthroat capitalism that makes it difficult to take time off work -- the pressure to be employable in fear that the employers won't take you back. An anarchist commune would also be able to devote time and resources to help raise each other's children. 

TL;DR: Having kids is disincentivized. An-comm could remove disincentives."

"&gt; The idea that it would have cost millions of American lives was essentially cooked up after the war as a ex post facto moral justification for the bombing, I think it first appeared in an article in 1946 defending the bombing.

In Giangreco's excellent book, ""Hell to Pay: Operation Downfall and the Invasion of Japan"", he spends a full chapter on the casualty question.  The notion that we would suffer 82,000 casualties in the Battle of Okinawa but only 100,000 in the longer and more stiffly-contested invasion of Japan is laughable.  Giangreco shows that the estimates of &gt; 1 million killed &amp; wounded are probably much closer to the reality.  It was NOT ""cooked up"" in 1946.

"&gt; If you have been primed to assume racism is the motive behind any action, it would make sense that you would believe that people are doing things because they are racist.



And if you've never been the target of systemic, institutional racism, you have been primed to believe racism isn't really as bad or as pervasive as it truly is because it is largely hidden from you.

"You're completely full of shit and not looking at the total expenses of building and maintaining that golf course, not to mention the obnoxious amount of equipment that you need to play it.

See where I'm going with this? All of this costs money, and it's insanely intensive in terms of maintenance and environmental impact.

Oh, and for those carts to move your fat ass around, you have to mine the metals in Russia, drill the oil for the plastics in the Middle East, send everything to China for part production, put it on a bigass tanker and ship it halfway around the world to Mexico for final assembly and finally truck it across the border to the course.

Just put a little lava so it doesn't get too deep.
"Dr. George E. Ulrich, Ph.D., BROWN 1955,  Beta Nu Chapter
Astro-Geologist &amp; Lava Scientist, U.S. Geological Survey, Flagstaff
Brother Ulrich became known as the geologist who stepped into lava.  On Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii, June 12, 1985, geologist George Ulrich had just taken a temperature reading of fresh lava, 2,079 degrees. Suddenly a lava crust broke, and Ulrich stepped into the lava over his boots but was protected by NOMEX burn-resistant clothing.  Another geologist pulled him out in about five seconds. Ulrich was flown to Straub Clinic &amp; Hospital on Oahu for treatment of first-, second- and third-degree burns. **He recovered fully.**

------

In 1985, George Ulrich and his Italian colleague, Dario Tedesco planned to take measurements and samples in the latest eruption of Pu’u’O’o, the still-active eruptive vent on Kilauhea.  Ulrich geared up in jeans, leather boots, and a fire-retardant flight suit.  He also grabbed his Filson hunting vest, which he’d rigged to care a vapor collection system and the other unusual paraphernalia of a vulcanologist. 

A helicopter dropped them near the vent, and they moved quickly to one of the many pahoehoe flows.  Using a thermocouple, they measured the temperature of the fast-flowing lava: 1,137 degrees C (2,078 degrees F).  Ulrich’s next task was to collect a sample of lava for chemical analysis. 

Here’s how Ulrich described what happened next:
&gt; “I walked quickly across the crusted surface, assuming I would easily recognize the newly cooled lava flow.  Dario stayed with the equipment and watched from the edge.  I approached what I thought was the new pahoehoe, but didn’t notice [that] the surface I was standing on was essentially flat.  It had no clear-cut boundary between the thicker, older crust and the thin new crust beyond.  The surface shone with a uniformly bright, silvery reflection.  If there were any thin, glowing cracks in the new crust, I never saw them.   I reached what I thought  was the place where we had extracted the thermocouple moments before.  I averted my face toward the right, intending to scoop up the molten lavea sample on the pick in my left hand.  I bent over to pierce the new crust.  As I looked down, I saw the crust open up and felt it give way beneath me.  The molten lava engulfed my legs…..” 

We stared at the museum display of Ulrich’s lava-coated pick and charred flight suit.  Not only did he survive but he had no long-term damage after much time in the hospital. How in the world had he managed to keep his legs? Geologist Wendell Duffield speculates that Ulrich’s legs were likely saved because they were immersed for only a few seconds and because a rapidly-cooled layer of insulating rock may have formed around Ulrich’s leg and then broken off when he pulled his legs free.  Fast medical care didn’t hurt either. - See more at: http://www.filson.com/filson-life/2012/02/guest-blog-seth-isenberg-filson-on-the-volcano/#sthash.neSVLclZ.dpuf

"My husband is the same way, low sex drive. I completely understand how frazzled it can make you feel. 

Making him feel bad, only makes it worse. So voicing your concerns and having multiple ""talks"" doesn't usually make things better.

Getting him in the mood is what you need to do. He needs more time to warm up, needs notice, needs romance and massages and cuddling, and music, lingerie, talking, porn, joking, strip clubs. He needs to feel very bonded and connected as well as turned on. If you're okay with pot usage try that. It might help him relax.

 I usually do this only on the weekend, so we have all night and don't have to worry about getting up early. After a few long nights under your belt, quickies start to happen more frequently. 

Ask him what he thinks about when he masterbates, and use that info to spark his sex drive. If you're comfortable talking about past relationships, ask questions like the best sex you ever had besides me, things like that. Places he masterbated. Have all your intimate talking be about sex.

 He'll be more open to experimentation if you present it in a comfortable manner, tell him he needs to learn what he likes for both of you. But only do new things when he's really revved up. If he's super turned on already the new toy/method will be much more enjoyable. 

You will have sex less than you want, you're going to have to accept that. BUT when I have sex, It's GREAT! because all that foreplay helps for both of us. "

"Telling someone they have the *option* to legally do something is less restrictive and aggressive than telling them they *can't* do something even if it's a medical need or an extreme circumstance.  To me that is the key difference between the two positions you describe.  

One (the pro-choice argument) does not force any individual woman to make a decision about abortion. The other (the ""pro-life"") removes all options.  Restrictive legislation feels worse than legislation that opens doors, especially if the restrictive legislation is unwilling to compromise in even the most extreme of cases."

There was one surprise Brood in the grand finals, a Techies ban every one of the final day of games because EG used it to great effect in an upper bracket game versus Ehome, and Luna didn't show up in the last 2 series.

I think one team picked Luna after Secret won with it. The meta didn't really shift much to favor her over any other carry, really. They let Lesh through once. LGD let it through three times. It ultimately cost them."

"I'm really excited for my mum to meet her and the baby. I know she's going to be thrilled. She's already asking for pics multiple times a day, she's waited a long time to be a grandma. She definitely didn't expect it to happen this way but she's excited nonetheless. I'm 100% certain she will be bawling. 

My dad was pretty cool about it. He's excited too, but he runs his own business so he couldn't take time off to come meet the baby this week. He messaged me today after we hadn't spoken for a couple days and told me he wants the baby to refer to him as Deda (grandpa in our family's language) so he's definitely thinking about it. My mom says he's looking forward to coming to visit next time he has a long weekend.

"My point is spectators will ALWAYS come up with a ""well that must be how this is done"" if they really want to. And once you open the door to them controlling how you perform, they're running your show, not you.

A spectator wants to take the deck from you, select a card, put it back in, shuffle it, then give it back to you before continuing... what then? Give up? Fish for it and hope to find it and make a somewhat magical revelation involving a top change without looking like you were doing exactly that? Laugh it away with some type of gag? 

Let's say they do say ""Well that must be how this is done."" So what? It's ONE spectator at ONE show and you still have the rest of your magic career. If this happens EVERY time you perform that effect, then you have a problem in structure and staging.

But generally, I won't let a spectator put me in a position of ""proving."" When a spectator has something to say it is either because I have an issue with my performance or the spectator is genuinely trying to figure it out. If the same issue comes up repeatedly, then it's MY problem. But once in a while... who cares?"

I find it rather crappy to pay for this amount of internet that we don't even get in first place. I can't even open GW2, because of how bad the speed is. I know it's not under my control or power how this internet company is run. Also the lack of how many cable guys it took to just HIT THE SWITCH ON. Nicholas Traveler as a whole has been one of the dearest and closest things to my heart since Guild Wars 1. I guess when things fail it's one of my weak points that I beat myself up harder than most. This past month has been a bumpy ride in life as a whole. All I want is some stupid decent internet so I can do this event and get back to doing what I love. Talking to all you wonderful folks and playing a game I love. Making these silly fun quests for you guys to laugh or feel part of adventure itself. I eat, drink, and sleep all these ideas and feel like I pester family &amp; friends with my thoughts, and what I want to do or where I want to go with this. Video games and testing them and breaking them, and building mods, servers, so forth and so forth.. it's an amazing world to me. So when the simple internet speed doesn't work and I can't do my job as Kit or Mr.Sprinkle can't get those sweet treats you sneak to him in the mail wink emoticon, it overall kind of blows. I hope you guys know we enjoy everything that you send to us. Even simple thank you's and to know that couples, families and kids all enjoy these adventures makes me really happy.

"This is THE takeaway point here, and some moron down voted you.

The discussion is on how the iPhone and other smart phones are trying to replace SLRs since they ALREADY are used to take most of the photos. They are ALREADY at the point where they are good enough.

People are talking about how an SLR will always be better -- but they've failed to look at even current history. ""Better"" is not always the winner but ""good enough"" will always be. ""Good enough"" is not too expensive. And smart phones already have more R&amp;D dollars than SLR cameras -- so the break throughs may eventually not move up the chain, because very few people will be buying SLRs at that point.

And I've seen a lot of examples of limited thinking because people have ""some"" understanding of optics, but don't realize that computer cameras and sensors already have licked a lot of the problems of aperture, DOF and such. A Samsung and Apple smart phone already take pictures there are FAR BETTER than what anyone could do with old fashioned optics decades ago. 

If Apple was just relying on optics like a film camera, they would have truly crappy images. They aren't -- obviously, so the limitations people are ascribing to ""Physics"" are their own misunderstanding of how the images are currently being made."

So, let's apply that to Box Set II. It's being released in Japan at the beginning of October. Let's put 5 months to that and we're looking around the beginning of March.

So, 5 months between Box Set I and II. Around the beginning of March is where the dub of season II should be released."

"Bad news! Decent size hole in the side of piston. KIPS valves also broken. Looks like the bit of piston has fallen down into the crank, guessing that's where it's potentially gotten stuck and jammed everything up. Still have to split the case and find it, but speaking to a few bike shops, chances of it falling in and not damaging the crank are minimal. 

Got them to run me through some prices too, and it's adding up pretty quick. Might not be worth getting done, unless I'm very lucky and the missing bit of piston is just wedged somewhere and hasn't damaged anything.

Do these prices sound about right (AUD)

The USA does not have a shortage of low and medium skilled workers.  If you look at our unemployment and underemployment figures, we have a huge surplus.  We do not need migrant labor.

"I understand exactly where you are coming from (Yeah I know it doesn't happen often. LOL!"".  But to me just saying something is rare without adding any sort of real value to it just fails.  

1926 Dom Perignon can go for as high as $26,000 and it is the most rare of its breed.  It's Champagne and yet it has such value.  Again monetary value. 

So where I take issue with the claim that Scythes are so special because they are rare is that CR would have to place a monetary value on it   Picasso's The Hairdresser is worth millions of dollars and everyone agrees to that, no question.  it has a value attached to it.  But saying that a Vanduul Scythe holds high value because it is rare and not placing a monetary value to it doesn't make it truly valuable at all.  Maybe to someone that is a ship collector, but to anyone else a ship that has no monetary value to it even if it is one of 300 is nothing more than a training drone or an asset for a clandestine operation.

As for whether or not anyone asked if he was okay, that doesn't matter. Bryce is a tough guy, he has waved off trainers frequently. Here, you have to give your guy a second to walk it off, to see if it continues. Bryce himself said it felt a lot worse at first than it was. He wasn't noticeably gimping until he ran, so with a tough guy like Bryce, you can give him a little freedom. Matt pulled him right after the limp was noticeable, and unless there is any legit evidence of some kind of clubhouse lethargy, I think you are reading way too much into this one.

How long are Ajax going to continue putting in horrible crosses
"1. Atheism is about God, not a higher power. To some people, in some contexts, that distinction might be important. To other people or in other contexts those terms might be interchangeable. For example, I would be likely to say that God (by definition) is a person and that there are just zero or one of them. I'd be less likely to say that about ""higher beings"".

2. No one thinks ""atheist"" should mean that the person is 100% sure that there is not God.
    * *Some* people would say that everyone who *lacks a believe* in God is an atheist. That would include babies, who simply have not learned the concept of God, and therefore can't be said to believe in God.
    * Others might say they are atheists because it's most *reasonable* to live your life as if there were no God.
    * Some might be atheists because they think no one can know that there is a God (being an atheist and being an agnostic are not mutually exclusive).
    * Some are atheists because they have reasonably high confidence (e.g. more that 50%) that there is no God.

3. No one is quick to say that there is no higher power. If you have that believe (and as I said in 2, not all atheists might have it), then you most likely have it because that's how you were raised or because you came to that conclusion after a long time of either gradually loosing faith or pondering those issues."

"Just to add on to what Alxe said, DLC stands for Downloadable Content, and since these days almost all content is downloadable (not sold as a hard copy), technically every addition is DLC.

However, there is a negative connotation that comes along with the term that DLC is ""small content"" and often times just not worth much. 

So even though After Dark is DLC, we like to use the term Expansion to denote that this is a very substantial addon. We want to inspire the feeling that expansions used to give players, like when you bought Starcraft: Brood War, or Rollercoaster Tycoon: Corkscrew Follies, or Simcity 4: Rush Hour"

"Cool! I love to teach people new things! Haha! 

I have been learning a lot on this subreddit. True to my personality type, I need to read everything I can get my hands on. It's part of the obsession. I have been scouring the internet trying to find advice when it is all kind of similar. I still feel like I need to do it constantly. 

So yeah, basically I have a hard time controlling my thoughts so everything just festers. Most people can control these ""bad"" thoughts and are able to deal with things in a healthier way. I tend to immerse myself in the thoughts until I am basically just spiraling out of control. For this reason, I am having a hard time seeing myself adapt to a poly lifestyle but I am trying my best!

Please cite one current criminal case for cheating. Cannot find it? Maybe it is because those laws are as bogus as ones that make homosexuality, sex toys and porn illegal. 

They are not enforced because it would never hold up, and the only reason they are still on the books is because nobody bothered to repeal them. 

It does not bmake a difference, it is a non-enforceable law, as much as any other stupid law in the books:

**Alabama:**

Masks may not be worn in public.

It is considered an offense to open an umbrella on a street, for fear of spooking horses.

It is illegal to sell peanuts in Lee County after sundown on Wednesday.

**It is illegal to wear a fake moustache that causes laughter in church.** 

Putting salt on a railroad track may be punishable by death.

Boogers may not be flicked into the wind.

It is legal to drive the wrong way down a one-way street if you have a lantern attached to the front of your automobile.

You must have windshield wipers on your car.

You may not have an ice cream cone in your back pocket at any time.

"They are Repackaging their same game, Actually optimized it, and added in a little bit of content, their original price for the first one was 90$, for a 5$ worth of decent gameplay.

They even said that they would be giving it for free for people who already own the original and then only gave it to those who bought the 90$ price tag or higher.

They ripped you off no matter which way you look at it. Defend them all you want, but it won't make all that money you spent look any less wasted than it was.

Just look at all the negative reviews on steam saying they ripped us off. They didn't fix any of the bugs, they only added big units and changed a few smaller things... that is IT for 40 dollars...

"&gt;The dropout rate is so high because the courses aren't easy.

I find this very hard to believe.  This is an art school, not a law school. I was an art major at a college with a very reputable art department and there was nothing difficult about my art classes.  Of course you need talent and a work ethic to succeed in the field, but *no one* drops out of art school because the classes are hard.  I have friends who attended art schools with much better reputations than AAU and the same was true there.  If you can pay the tuition and you do the assignments, you're going to pass.  The only way to flunk an art class is by not doing the assignments.  *Difficulty* is not the problem.

If there is a high dropout rate, it is because of the high tuition and probably the realization that they're getting screwed.  The recruiter tells you about all the great jobs there are out there for art grads and a year or so in and you realize that it's not like that at all.  The only thing that really matters is your portfolio and you don't have to put yourself tens of thousands of dollars in debt to produce it.

&gt;The students that actually make it through the program

A for-profit school is highly motivated to keep their students enrolled.  They're not going to chase people out by making it too difficult.  (You wouldn't by any chance work for AAU, BTW?)

I'm not saying that you can't learn things there.  I'm just saying that the degree isn't worth anything.

Edit:  I want to add that a high dropout rate is common in most for-profit colleges, and you're not going to convince anyone that it's because the classes are so hard."

Thanks for the hatch.
"Frankly, I think it's a fundamental design flaw w/ PoE rather than an issue of adding another objective. It's an arena style format that sees us battling the same waves of mobs coming out of the same doors at every round. Whether you're disarming mines, killing VIP, or whatever... the end result is mostly the same. Doors open, mobs spill out, kill them. Maybe it gets mixed up a little with the objectives. But mostly you're just trying to stay alive, kill adds. The objectives really just force you to actually move around, rather than significantly change the game play itself.

The only interesting mechanics are at the boss level rounds w/ detainment fields, flaming ground, taint, etc... "

Pro tip, if you're really craving it: Put a can of full fat coconut milk in the fridge overnight. Spoon the fat off of the top and whisk it with half a cup of melted chocolate chips (just read the ingredients to get ones that don't have milk). After about 5 minutes of whisking you'll have an extremely rich chocolate mousse. Serves two."

"Umm, that's not too far from how the majority of bank robberies actually do go down.  In a former life, I was on site for three different bank robberies, and in all three cases none of the other customers or employees realized a robbery was happening!  

The person walks quietly to the teller, passes them a note, and the teller presses the silent alarm and gives them the money (with dye pack inside).  In two of the three, the person didn't show or even mention a weapon.  The well-organized, machine-gun-brandishing bank robber gangs with murder on their mind are almost entirely a Hollywood fabrication.  

Also, they *always* get caught and the take is about $2,500 at the absolute most, which all gets blasted by dye packs anyway so you can't even spend it.  Plus the paperwork is a huge pain in the ass and everybody's got kids to pick up and a spin class to get to, so if you absolutely must rob a bank, please try to get there more than thirty minutes before quittin' time."

"The thing about a familiar as opposed to a pet is the action economy.   A familiar has a telepathic bond and will do what you want it to without consuming any action.  The same is somewhat true of unseen servant.  

Also, an owl familiar (and/or a homunculus) can be added to any bad guy for only 10 XP and +1 creature to the encounter budget.  Further, the bad guy's owl familiar can have immunity to piercing, force, and fire damage and still remain a CR0.  So in the war of familiars, the bad guys can win if the DM wants.  When I'm DMing with players who have played with me before, the first task in many encounters is to eliminate the acolyte's familiar."

Re: bugs in soil. What kind of potting soil mix are you using?

Ordinary garden denizens such as stag beetles and earthworms don't normally colonize container plants, as the soil doesn't support the large and complex ecosystem they require. There's nothing to eat, IOW.  If the pots sit directly on the ground, it's possible for them to host pillbugs (millipedes), ants, and slugs at the point of contact between the pot and the ground, but those are easily dealt with when you're ready to bring the pot indoors, by mixing up a solution of insecticidal soap in a basin or tub, and soaking the entire pot in it for 20 minutes or so, let drain.

Post pictures of your plants. You should know what you're growing anyway, so this is a good time to find out. Knowledge is power.

Many species of succulent can stay outdoors all winter in Bristol, especially in an urban heat sink.

"&gt; Before ACA the only good medical insurance was group coverage through an employer. If you did not have an employer that provided medical insurance then you were out of luck.

Not true at all.  There was individual market insurance, and let's not forget -- employer-based coverage is a response to government market distortion.  If employers had to pay payroll tax on compensation in the form of healthcare, they would just pay their employees the difference, and almost everyone would be shopping around for their individual healthcare.

Also, there were like, tons of websites you could buy health insurance from, and they worked, and they didn't cost **two billion dollars**.

&gt;Now, with ACA, anybody can buy individual medical insurance that is just as good as the group policies that were available only through employers.

This is false.

&gt; I can assure you that there are lots of people who are very happy about that.

No, they're not, because that doesn't happen, but there ARE people who are getting heavily subsidized by ""wealthier"" healthcare customers.  They're happy.  But they're happy in the same way that Paul is happy, now that you've just given him money that you had stolen from Peter."

"I'd tell any of these to anyone who asked, so I'm going to count them as both my real reasons and PC reasons.

1. I inherited my mother's temper and impatience. I can only explain something maybe twice before I get annoyed and something making that much noise non-stop would make me want to throw it at a wall (probably wouldn't, but still), especially with my headaches. And these days you can't discipline a child without having people want to call the police.

2. Medical issues. With my issues, not sure I could even carry a pregnancy to term without miscarrying - I'm epileptic. Also combining the genes I inherited from my family and the ones he has from his family (heart issues, high blood pressure, diabetes, anxiety, etc) I wouldn't want to put any of those on another person.

3. I'm a little selfish. I like my alone time with my husband and wouldn't want to share it with a child. I also like being able to do what I want - like if I want to stay in and watch Buffy reruns all weekend, I'm free to. And also money - I like spending it on us. I will loan out money if I'm asked nicely (and to those who haven't abused the privilege), but I always assume I'm not getting it back.

If I needed to add more:

4. The horrible shape public schools are in any more. I wouldn't be able to afford private and wouldn't want to deal with home-school.

5. Financial reasons. We have enough for bills, a little entertainment and spending money, and a little for savings - but honestly not enough to raise a child properly.

6. If I desperately feel the urge for a child and somehow all the reasons I mentioned stopped mattering and I lost my mind, I'd adopt before having a child of my own. There's too many kids out there needing homes anyways.


Edit: For some reason, I can't get the last three to list as 4, 5, and 6."

I've lived here 30 years and that's the first time I've ever heard that. Seriously. More expensive than where? Tampa? St. Pete? Miami? Orlando? Atlanta? Sorry, but no way.

Jacksonville does have some serious negatives. Violent crime is high but also pretty localized is certain areas. The place is still repeatedly screwed by the Baptist church's stranglehold on local politics - although, thankfully that's beginning to change. The downtown area is picking up but it's moving too slow and is being co-opted by a local commercial property dingus named Sleiman who's playing the city council like a fiddle.

Our schools system sucks and the current school superintendent is a godawfully bad teach-to-the-test pinhead.

Traffic is bad, development is borderline out-of-control and our property taxes are too low to support a functioning city government of our size.

But the major bright spots about Jacksonville are the high availability of decently paying jobs and the extremely low cost of living. Even the beach housing is comparatively cheap compared with other beach communities."

"I think the best approach to take when switching to Ubuntu is to look at it like a hobby/project.

Install it in some way that lets you dual boot. Then, when you feel like it, spend some time in Ubuntu configuring applications, finding alternatives and just learning how to go about doing things.  

Most  people I know who just jumped into Ubuntu feet first and hoped everything would 'be just like it was' got disappointed fast.   You have to spend some time with it before everything 'clicks' and you're happy with it.  Some of those things can still be pretty frustrating to figure out.

So, just look at it as a project you work on when you want to.   You'll always have your Windows OS to go to if you need to 'get shit done'.   But, eventually, as you get things working and get used to the environment, you'll start spending more and more time in Ubuntu.

"&gt;our model projects a team’s odds of reaching the divisional playoffs in the current season as a function of its estimated true talent and its “coin flip mode” playoff odds (its odds of making the playoffs if every remaining game were 50/50) as of July 31.

That's an important note there.  I can kind of see why they chose it--with all the players moving around you don't really know what the teams might do in the final two months.  But my problem with the coinflip mode is that it spits out a seemingly reasonable result for any game, but the end results of the season are unreasonable-- every time.  It just flatlines the records to the end of the year (like, on the graphical standings it would be literally a flat line for each team from this point to the end of the season.)

I wonder what the hurdles would be to incorporate even the linear fit (the win%) as the base-line projection.  

But I have to think using something like fangraph's season to date projections, or zips projections would be even better. 

Maybe they needed to keep it consistent across this current year and the future 6 years."

"There's no way to prove God to a greater degree of epistemic certainty than we can prove other facts derived from sensory observation. I could be a brain in a vat right now, but no one seriously thinks that it's therefore unreasonable for me to believe that I'm sitting at my desk.

What you've got to do, if you want to construct hypothetical good evidence for God, is propose a scenario for which all non-theistic alternative explanations are just as outlandish as the claim that out there somewhere is an invisible being who can create universes.

For instance, if I see God appear to me but no one else sees him, the most likely explanation is that I'm hallucinating. If I see God and everyone around me sees him too, are we all hallucinating together? Do we all share some sort of faith commitment that would make us especially susceptible to confirmation bias or group delusion? Am I hallucinating both God and the other witnesses? What if these are all people I know, and I continue regularly discussing the event with them over the next 40 years? Could I really hallucinate 40 years of my life?

Here's another good example I've seen around here: Imagine we encountered an alien species, and *they* had a religion very similar to Christianity that described the child of the creator of the universe taking the form of a mostly-hairless bipedal organism on a planet described to be just like ours so that he could be crucified, rise again, and return back to wherever the creator lives. Imagine that we encounter multiple independent extraterrestrial civilizations, and *all* of them have a religion more or less wholly consistent with Christianity. Since it's a hypothetical, make it as detailed as you like—a degree of mutual agreement that just seems to defy any possible naturalistic explanation.

Would there be alternative, naturalistic explanations for this? Sure. Maybe the aliens are all just screwing with us. Maybe there's some undiscovered principle of cognitive biology at work that causes all creatures of a relatively-human intelligence level to construct similar mythologies. There is never going to be evidence for God that committed atheists couldn't explain away in some fashion, just as committed believers are always able to explain away flaws in their reasoning and devastating contradictions in their holy books. But I can certainly envision scenarios in which I would be forced to concede that ""God did it"" is no more improbable than any competing explanation."

"My step-dad has been at an extremely successful AutoZone location for almost a decade, and held a management position for 4 of those years. He has 30 years of experience in the auto industry. 

He just started making $12 an hour this year. 

My mom has worked at a major hospital for a decade doing medical billing/coding, and for the last two years has, in addition, been working a reception position and doing digitalization/archive stuff, with no increase in pay. 

She makes $11.75 ($11.85 starting next year when she gets her yearly 10 cent raise). She had a seizure at work last year due to flickering light tubes in the basement she works in, which she'd asked to be replaced several times. She now owes over a years salary in medical bills because she ""only"" had the best Healthcare her employer offers. 

I don't give a shit how much a burger flipper makes, if it means hardworking Americans are able to be compensated fairly, and thays bot happening at the moment. 

Something needs to change. I think the best idea currently is an increase over the next several years to a national $15/hr minimum wage. Coupled, of course, with Universal Healthcare.

Further, that number is intentionally crafted to be deceptive, since even if every single woman that walked through their doors had an abortion, the number of abortions performed would be around 25% and only a little over half of the visits would be considered to be for abortions. (2.7 million women received 10.6 million services in 4.6 million visits.) 

A more relevant statistic (for that argument, not this one) is that 12% of the women they saw had an abortion at their facility. I can't figure out if that includes medication abortions or not, since their other literature distinguishes it from an abortion procedure. If not, the number is likely closer to 20% or higher."

Teacher was a know it all (like myself), thought he knew MBTI, didn't. Gave us a printout from the MBTI website with vague type descriptions, told us to run with it.

I thought I was an *INFJ.*

High school was a dark time in my life. Found strengthsfinder. Forgot about MBTI.

Went to college, became hypersocial.

Became *reeeeeaallly* friendly. Became really ""spontaneous"" (my brand of spontaneity is extremely fast last minute planning). Roommates left me. Learned about MBTI again and *took an actual test.* ENFP. Joined PerC.

But alas, that did not fit quite well.

 After 3 hellish months I realized I was actually an ENTP. I really do like to play devil's advocate. I'm a master debater, and I absorb knowledge. I'm extremely inventive, etc. etc.

This went on for like 6 months. 

Fit me much better than ENFP. I joined reddit, played with my fellow ENTPs for awhile.

But it still didn't fit quite right. So I looked into the deathlords of destruction, the managers or the annoying midlevel managers, the ENTJs.

And as I did some digging beyond the base profiles, I learned that all of the reasons I thought I was ENTP fit even better as an ENTJ. An ENTP with vision. An ENTP that loves command. An ENTP that likes to debate seriously as well as facetiously. An ENTP that's great with women. 

A lot of ESTJs must try to type as ENTJs, because we're not nearly as overtly dominating as they are.

Rather, we prefer to covertly dominate while overtly ""persuading."""

"I'd like to point since I was mentioned here ( for some reason? :D ) out that when using the term ""left"" I am talking about the mainstream definition in terms of the political compass. I can understand why there would be some traditional leftists that take issue with being grouped up with that though. If it makes you feel any better capitalists and voluntarysts always get grouped up with the likes of neo-nazi's and social conservatives even though we have nothing to do with the fuckers.

If I started talking about Feminists as Matriarchs ( which is what I believe these people truly are ) and so on in terms of misandry and the detailed differences of Authoritarianism and Libertarian Socialists etc. then people just wouldn't get it because their knowledge doesn't extend that far in politics.

I would agree though it is partly propaganda and I'd rather not have to use those kind of political terms, however we don't have the luxury because that's what the majority of people believe. It's a lot like how the term 'liberal' has been totally butchered now and if you want to talk about real 'liberals' you have to use the term 'classic liberalism' so people understand and don't confuse it with the morons we have now.

Hope that clears things up, if you feel the need to use a different tag than being ""Left"" I don't blame you in the slightest, this is also partly why I make a point of calling myself an Anarcho-Voluntaryst leaning towards capitalism rather than a pure capitalist or anti-capitalist because of the frequent stereotypes and bullshit definitions associated with the more traditional versions of Anarchism because morons have started hijacking the more well known ideologies without actually knowing what it all means."

Linku pls?

&gt;1. Every weapon doesn't have to have a weapon art. Also I don't think they do. 2. Weapon arts wouldn't mean any less weapons, power stancing is an example of that. There could be weapons that have the same weapon art stances as others. Basing amount of weapons solely off of sword arts is silly. Swords arts could be special to some weapons then also be specific to a class of weapon. Like normal long swords all have the same weapon art but boss weapons have special or rarer weapons do.

That being said, I don't think every photo in this set is entirely ""bad""—taking into context the camera I used, I think some of my photos were exposed perfectly, namely the trash bin one. And yes, my finger is in one of them, which objectively detracts from the composition, but I still find the lighting in it to be intriguing regardless. I don't think it's fair to say that none of these photos include a subject. These photos were explorations in light/shadow-play within symbols of suburbia, and I think I succeeded in a few of them. Nevertheless, I appreciate your comments and will take into account what you said when shooting in the future!"
"He is inconsistent, which is very worrying. Lambie is a less risky option because he makes fewer errors, kicks better (out of hand and off the tee), and is better on defense. But Lambie also doesn't break the line as often or create as many opportunities for our outside backs. 

It's very tough to decide which is better, because you're effectively gambling. If you play Lambie, you're gambling other players will create enough scoring opportunities. If you're playing Pollard, you're gambling he won't give the game away.

People need to divide the player from the character/nation. This seems to be a common problem in this game - Yashou are villains. edgeheadedguy is, probably, a really swell person. My nation has done some horrible shit the nations around it, but they each know that's the nation, not me. If we all associated the actions of a nation with the actions of a player, I doubt most of us would still be around. "

"NP is a master of genre, that's for sure. He hit every single crime / noir influence possible, which some may see as cliche or too campy but I enjoyed. It makes you almost able to smile at the grimness.

"well i dont know, from what i read (in hard stats) everything the t71's got, the bulldog also has, plus 4 rounds in its autoloader.

with the autoloader, its got more hp (70!), more theoretical top speed (+8) while only lacking in 1pwr/weight

if its using the m32 late (top gun) then its got more dpm than the t71 (1850 vs 2180) with better aim and dispersion (though thats a given since its not an autoloader) 

the bulldog also has better soft stats in movement:
a difference of .2 on hard, .2 on med, and .4 on soft. its notmuch but it is superior in that regard. turret traverse is 6 degrees faster, as well as 5deg extra gun elevation not that thats a big deal

in my opinion, with the m32 gun's extra dpm and the large amount of extra health, the bulldog definitely outclasses the t71 in everything it does (besides view range). its a larger tank with the same amount of camo and marginally better soft stats (and armor but pft armor) 

even with the autoloader though, it outclasses the t71 in burst damage with 4 more rounds. it seems like the t71 just gets left in the shadow of a much better tier 7 american light."

"Heh. My Ph.D. is in algorithms, combinatorics, and optimization, so I also fall somewhere in the middle of that math–CS spectrum.

I admit I forgot about homotopy type theory.

Perhaps the takeaway here should be that computer science is a branch of mathematics, and it is difficult to say that one branch of mathematics is not useful in some other branch of mathematics—there are always connections."

"Okay, forgive me but a lot of what you've written is BS, continuously spun by the media, looking for headlines.



1. Firstly we do NOT have £200m available in the bank for player purchases. We have debt of £230m still on our balance sheet, the cash that sits there balances out our debt, making our net debt just £30m. This is crucial for the financial stability of the club, in case we ever need to borrow extra until we pay the debt off. 
Our player purchases therefore are funded through a mixture of cash and revenue streams. We've got about £50m a year available, and it will remain like that for the forseeable future. If someone amazing is available, Wenger might be able to get the board to push that to £75m but that's it.



2. Wenger doesn't have total autonomy at Arsenal. It's a lovely story because it sounds so romantic, but the reality is that Gazidis and Kroenke decide how much money he has to spend. Similarly with fees, it is well within Gazidis' remit to say ""No"" if a transfer is overpriced. (And believe me, he would. He's an ex corporate lawyer who is very finance focused. He will care more about his career and future performance than any short term fan satisfaction).

3. Yes we have the highest season tickets, but that's again because the club want to raise as high revenues as possible. The point is - we don't rely on external finance from a sugar daddy to fund player purchases. We rely on revenues - from stadium attendance, advertising deals and other commercial streams and sponsorship. After that we still have about £30m of debt to repay each year.



Don't believe the crap that we're debt free! We've got cash but we need it as a contingency for the debt!"

"Piggybacking here.

Halo 1 had the MA5B. The only one with 60-round capacity, lowest accuracy of all of them, higher rate of fire, lower damage, lower range.

Halo 2 had no assault rifle. The SMG filled its niche.

Halo 3 had the MA5C. Down to 32 rounds, higher damage, lower fire rate. More like an actual assault rifle than a 7.62x51 ""submachine gun"".

Halo Reach had the MA37. Despite the name change, it IS the same series as the others. Slightly lower damage, lower fire rate, less accurate. Overall bad. (Noteworthy that this rifle was in service 2437-~2552, but all of the MA5 variants in here came into service in the span of less than 5 years.)

Halo 4 and Halo 5 have the MA5D. Never played the games, but cursory wiki search says it's ANOTHER fire rate reduction and damage buff.

From Halo 1 to Halo 4, the gun drops from 900 RPM to 610 RPM while becoming significantly more accurate (in bursts) and damaging.

There's also another version in the books, but it's not really relevant.

After that, I realized eBay isn't always going to be a viable way to succeed with ecommerce.

It's so vool to play normals with other plat players on Ip weekends and such. Because these guys usually have a lot of games and are just really funny in game while trying to make crazy plays. Also you get decent enemys and most of the time they are nice in all chat. I feel like when I play with silver friends the chat in normal games is just more tryhard and toxic in general. But higher elo people mainly play normals for fun not to ge better or win so the games are funnier and more relaxed at least in terms of atmosphere.

"It's a shame the article itself isn't viewable...I wondered if they differentiated between *type* of porn being used and/or *quantity* of porn being used.  In people who watch a non-obsessive amount of relatively mainstream porn (otherwise known as well over 50% of the population, if not the vast majority of the population) compared to people who *never* watch porn (ie, an unusual bunch who probably have a rigid set of psychological reasons for never doing so, like fundamentalist religious or gendered beliefs), I would expect to get just those results.

However, having known a few people who had either an unhealthily obsessive rate of porn consumption and/or watched some very, very nasty porn, and what they were like...I wouldn't expect to get those results.  So, it'd be nice to know exactly what population they looked at and what their criteria were."

The writing is just not coming as easily. And I think Maynard gets bored after awhile. I was reading an AMA with Billy Howerdel and he made 2 references to Maynard being consumed by other projects, and just not as into it anymore...without which, we could get anew APC album!"

"It's a double edged sword. I've been around XBL since its inception. In the early days 90% of the entertainment value was just fucking with people and see how they'd react. It was very much so about pushing the envelope and seeing what sort of outrageous stuff you could do/say and how people would react. Immature? Sure but this was also the first time console users ever had this type of thing so there was a novelty and entertainment aspect to it as well. In time most of us grew past it, it was sort of a ""Ok, we've done that whole thing, let's actually play"" type thing. 

Fast forward to today, over a decade later. I've probably played 150 games of FIFA and had only one actually interaction over the head set. That said that interaction was a guy talking insane shit, it was a combination of infuriating and invigorating. As he poured on the shit talking I dismantled him in the game, and then took to shit talk back. It was one of the more exciting games I've played and it was all because of his shit talking. Now don't get me wrong, he was annoying as shit, and outside of that happening maybe once out of every 25 games I'd lose my mind... but that being said it does make the game more exciting if it's not always happening."

"I don't have children but I plan to in the future. Hopefully they'll be educated in Ontario. I have a background in sexuality and sexual health so I know my children will be in good hands if I did have to give them a more in-depth sexual education at home. But I can't vouch for what sort of at-home sex ed their potential partners might have. That's why a support an updated sexual health curriculum that uses proper names for anatomy (which helps a lot in thwarting childhood sexual abuse), encourages consent and bodily autonomy (so my daughter knows that it isn't simply playful fun if her classmates try to lift her skirt up in the hallway), and informs students about the reality of negotiating their sexuality in the internet age (the Ontario curriculum was last updated in 1998 before PC computers with a fast internet connection was a thing, before Facebook and Twitter and other social media platforms were a thing, before almost every kid has some sort of camera phone). Those were all policies that were going to be revamped in this curriculum and Brown exaggerates its realities (no, your kid isn't going to be taught to masturbate or kiss members of the same-sex in Grade 1 even though masturbation can be talked about if prompted in older grades and same-sex relationships may be addressed) and generally opposes the progress this curriculum makes.

"&gt; singer is merely suggesting we give up things like starbucks and opera tickets and give 10% of our extra money in charity.

I think what throws most people for a spin when it comes to Singer is that the drowning child metaphor is so far removed from the reality of giving money to charity. Saving a drowning child is something you do because it's happening right in front of you, you're in a prime position to directly save the child's life, and you are in sole control of the situation. Giving money to charity is something you do because people tell you your money will be spent in a certain way that will help to aid people who are suffering--now you are comparatively blind (it's not happening right in front of you), you have no skin in the game (you're in no position to save anyone's life directly), and you have little to no control over the situation (you're giving your money to someone else and trusting them to use it for a good purpose).

&gt; You can't seriously consider yourself a moral person if you buy an xbox instead of giving that money to save someone's life. 

By the same logic, you can't seriously consider yourself a moral person if you spend your time writing ""you can't seriously consider yourself a moral person..."" on Reddit instead of spending that time formulating plans to save someone's life."

"I don't know, I thought the way Fuuka was handled really set it above Seo's other works.  Suzuka was very solid and I thought it had a fairly natural character progression, but a some of the drama felt really ""manufactured"" almost like a soap opera.  This got pushed to like a hundred in KNIM, but I still enjoyed it.  By the time I got to Fuuka, the formula kind of started to feel shallow and I feel like if the twist didn't happen we'd have to deal with the MC and Fuuka fighting, splitting up, MC getting with another girl, band splitting up and getting back together drama that Seo is kind of known for by now.  I think that would have been really stale and I'm glad to see Seo attempt to put a wrinkle in his work.

KNIM and Suzuka kind of suffered due to the fact that you already had a pretty good idea of who the MC was going to end up with which made all the drama along the way kind of annoying to get through because it felt really dragged out.  I think thats why KNIM got better once the main couple finally got back together, because all the forced drama was out of the way (bringing it back is also why i think the ending felt pretty weak).

Now with Fuuka we can really focus on the MC's growth as a character and get closer to all the side characters before we get back into romantic drama down the line (where I think the series will eventually head to).  Now we actually don't know who the MC will eventually pair up with and we get enough time to get to know the options so that the pairing will have more weight to it down the line.  Also MC staying single out of respect seems like a realistic option as well.

Theres a lot of potential here and I think a people are upset because they just wanted more of the same.  Once the series really starts to take off down the line I think it'll get back into what people expect from Seo, but be much more meaty and less shallow than his previous work. 

Theres a lot of potential here and I think readers should wait and see where it goes.  We're already kind of seeing the MC deal with survivors guilt, but we should eventually get to him getting over using Fuuka as his crutch for self improvement, him being afraid to move on and get in another relationship, and I think what might be most interesting, the MC struggling with new relationships because his relationship with Fuuka had been built to unrealistic standards.  Not sure if Seo will push it that far, but I think its something all people have to deal with after the death of a loved one and it would make for a very interesting read."

If they get to the point of seeing you naked and didn't disclose a gender identity that is not expected, then they are deceiving you.

"We would love to hear all of your questions! We have discussed this in depth and have a lot of ideas ourselves that we will iron own during implementation. 


That's a great question. Our implementation will be based on some new features we are rolling out in the next week or two that offers these theme'd designs to our users. We will then incorporate 3rd party offerings into the mix. Then we will rollout an actual marketplace tied into quick (possibly 1-click) integrations into your Editor.

Our invitation process is focused on finding people who can work with us. The skills matter but since this market place is for everyone, we want designers of all skill levels. We will outline what we need help with as we move closer to roll-out.

There will be design quality standards but also other factors such as completion. While /u/Jokosmash is a great designer and UX guy, we understand users have varied style &amp; quality preferences. Our goal is to offer complete and modular theme's to users that give them the tools to build their overlay. We think the best themes will not only incorporate graphics but usage of unique widgets. We will also communicate with our beta designers and find out what works for them.

"A non-smoker's ""happiness"" level is at 100 (random value obviously, doesn't matter). As a smoker, it decays with time and the lower you get, the more you want to smoke (and of course, the unhappier you get).

You haven't smoked for one hour? You're at 80. You just got out from a 3 hours meeting? You're at 50. You have a job interview coming up? You're at 20. 

Let's say you haven't smoked for one hour (80), and you do smoke. When you do, you somehow feel like you're above 100, that you feel even better than a non-smoker would. But you're not. You're in fact below the value a non-smoker would get (you're at 95 when he's still at 100). But if you put your hands in ice cold water for some time, putting them in warm water will feel really hot, more than the actual water's temperature.

When the non-smoker got out of his meeting, he was at 80. When you did and smoked just after, you were at 70 and still thinking ""I don't get how these dudes can handle these meetings without a cigarette right after!"", when in fact they were in a better shape than you!

When the non-smoker is stressing about his upcoming interview, he's at 50. When you smoke under the same circumstances, you go from 20 to 40. And you feel sorry for the non-smoker as he can't relieve stress like you do. Except he does better, don't worry.

The great lie of smoking is right here. Making you believe you feel better than a non-smoker when you just smoked, when instead you're just trying to close the gap with him, without even succeeding."

"Judicial temperament, Cleveland style:

CLEVELAND, Ohio – Suspended Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge Lance Mason pleaded guilty Thursday to charges that he beat his wife in front of their two children.

Mason, 47, attacked his wife while driving down Van Aken Blvd. on Aug. 2, 2014, court documents show. Mason punched his wife in the face several times, shoved her face into the car's dashboard, bit her twice on the cheek, and choked her with his arm. Aisha Mason suffered a broken left orbital bone as a result of the attack. She called 911 after Mason kicked her out of the car and drove off with their children."
"Be careful with your needles everyone! I learned this mistake the hard way after having half a needle used for cross stitching embedded in my foot (eye first!). The incident occurred Monday when I getting up after sitting on the floor of my living room while working on framing a finished piece, feeling a very sharp pain and having found a broken half of a needle. After an urgent care visit and trip to a podiatrist, I was in the hospital having emergency foot surgery to remove the object by Tuesday afternoon. Several inches worth of stitches later and an overnight stay in the hospital, the healing process begins with use of crutches and a driving ban for the next three weeks. I'll certainly be a lot more cautious with my equipment moving forward (if I can ever look at another needle again). 0/10, would not recommend.

"Sometimes it is, there's some stuff I just don't do. I only care about the Arena on my main phone, I casually play it a little on the others.

It's worth it though because I have very different luck on each account and it allows me to have some really nice guaranteed friends. I have fully maxed out Anima versions of Feeva, Deimos, Quaid and Medina on my crummy tablet account and I have Tridon, Zenia, Kannon and Griel on my iPhone 4S's account.

"How do you make an abortion post that doesn't mention the WOMAN a single time (except for when you're talking about rape). 

The ""personhood"" of the fetus is most certainly not the only factor, and IMO it is not the primary factor. If personhood matters so much to you, why are you ignoring the other person in the equation, the one we know FOR SURE exists as a person in every single situation, 1 through 4?? 

Even if the fetus is a person, people do not have the right to force themselves onto another person and force the other person to undergo a combination of these things for nine months (and beyond) against their will:

&gt;stretch marks (worse in younger women)

&gt;loose skin

&gt;permanent weight gain or redistribution

&gt;abdominal and vaginal muscle weakness

&gt;changes to breasts

&gt;increased foot size

&gt;varicose veins

&gt;scarring from episiotomy or c-section

&gt;other permanent aesthetic changes to the body (all of these are downplayed by women, because the culture values youth and beauty)

&gt;severe post-partum depression and psychosis

&gt;research now indicates a possible link between ovarian cancer and female fertility treatments, including ""egg harvesting"" from infertile women and donors

&gt;research also now indicates correlations between lower breast cancer survival rates and proximity in time to onset of cancer of last pregnancy

"Yep. Technically, any state can change their drinking age to whatever they want. It goes to the Drinking Age Act of 1984. States who have a drinking age lower than 21 lose 10% of federal funding for highways. Recent studies have tied the laws with less alcohol-related crashes/deaths and better health, but I'm of the opinion a lot of that has to do with prohibition vs moderation. In many other countries around the world, alcohol is introduced much younger and people don't binge the same way. They learn respect and moderation. Not that it doesn't ever happen, but I think its a much bigger problem in the US, so its almost self-fulfilling prophecy if you will."

Not saying you said or implied that, but anytime Polanski is mentioned in r/movies it sparks a debate over his life and films.

We need separate consideration for legal matters of artists and celebrities that doesn't take their careers into account, but anything with celebs tends to get blurred when they're rich enough to afford lawyers to help them beat the prosecution. How the hell is that fair, if we're all entitled to fair legal defense yet people can afford more and better lawyers than others?

What makes soda a ""waste of time""? That statement makes zero sense to me considering how you can buy soda cheap, in large quantities, and literally everywhere. It's way less time consuming and easier to get than stuff like pancakes. There's virtually no preparation time.

The gist I get from your comment is that you don't like the taste of soda and can't understand that other people might actually like it.

Besides, on the topic of drinking it because it simply tastes good (you're the one who brought up the whole ""get sugar"" idea), diet sodas let you get mostly the same degree of taste (it varies per person -- some people love diet sodas more and some people hate 'em) while being healthier than everything you mentioned (in that they're basically flavoured water)."

"Well now, the only way to get a legit license is via Upgrading from an older OS and the activation sequence running after bootup, or by buying a key.

Seeing as you had a 'catastrophic' failure, and with the only options available that Microsoft provides at the moment, is to reinstall Windows 7 or 8.1 and then do the in place upgrade, OR buy a key for the fresh install if you don't wish to spend time doing this process.

The free upgrade doesn't give you a key, it profiles your machine and stores that profile as your key on the activation servers. If you do a major hardware change out you have to call MS for re-activation.

I agree this practice sucks but it is the practice they chose for giving you a FREE upgrade. Yes the practice and be annoying, but calling MS will not guarantee you anything but more headaches."

"So ... soy milk for example. You want to not have a regular spacebar item and instead have a portable pedestal just in case you find soy milk later on and the use the portable pedestal to pick up soy milk just in case you get lump of coal, libra or a lot of damage items even later on?

Not have an active item just to later pick up antigrav *just in case* you get Brimstone + attractor?

Not have a spacebar... to get more red heart containers later on... instead of immediately just to save one or two soul hearts?

Why wouldn't you want to pick up a ressurect item immediately? (other than 9 lives) The only reason I see is to control the revive order, which is usually really unimportant. Either you want to die to get a benefit (shadow, rags) or it's just a safety net (9lives, ankh etc) which I would always give up for the benefit of the former items, in fact that just makes them more interesting.

And... no spacebar item just to *not* get the immediate benefits of Number one or dead onion but instead get the benefit later? (really the ""downsides"" of these items aren't downsides but stuff you have to learn and / or what make items more interesting).

No active item just to not pick up lokis horns.. until you get more luck? Until maybe dr fetus or ipecac gets overwritten by Brimstone or Moms Knife or Epic fetus?

Cursed eye? Either you can deal with the downside or you can't? Or are you really gonna wait to maybe get an item that the cursed eye's downside doesn't affect?

You got one good example, ""anything that removes hearts"" aka Abbadon (is there another one?). Sure you could choose to not have an active item to pick up abbadon to save HP for a later devil deal. But I'd still rather have the benefit immediately.

These cases are mostly about ""let me *not* take a [subjective] risk that might later turn into a non risk at the price of not having a regular active item"". Apart from the fact that I feel like this is exactly what the game is not about, this would (for me) never be worth not having a regular active item.

You got a good synergy going but find an item that messes with that synergy? So what? You wanna wait until that item creates a better synergy later on? No, man. You have to decide. You wanna keep that cool ""fun"" synergy going? Or do you need something better like moms knife to actually win?

I just really don't see it."

"Well, we're not a small school. For comparison, Florida state has an enrollment of 41,773, Virginia tech (who's dominating this thread) has an enrollment of 31,224, while we have an enrollment of 37,788. 

That being said, we're lucky if we fill even an eighth of the Linc with our own fans. The only times that even the lower bowl is even close to being filled is when we're playing a school with a huge program located semi-nearby. 

This is really because our football program is historically awful. We've only been ranked once in our entire existence, and that was in 1972, 43 years ago. We've been playing since 1894 and only have one conference title, which came from when we were in the Middle Atlantic Conference. 

We've always sucked. There was a flash of hope when we had Bernard Pierce but that fizzled out quickly. We're coming back a little, and I'm excited for the upcoming season, but for the most part, nobody gives a shit about temple football. 

To answer your question, our home attendance is routinely matched or exceeded by away fans in the stadium, so there really isn't a home field advantage at all. There's times where being in an empty stadium normally packed to the brim of loud eagles fans is surreal and even bothersome, and players I personally know feel the same way. And considering that we pay a million dollars a game as rent, we really shouldn't be playing there. "

"Alright, let's see what we got here. 

On **Thresh**, you built:

* **Ruby Sightstone** - It's always better to just sit on the basic Sightstone until you've completed all of your other items. The Gold you spend upgrading it is better spent on other items that give you more than a little more health. There's no functional difference between Sightstone and Ruby Sightstone.
* **Talisman of Ascension** - Great item. Extremely powerful and versatile active effect. I always prefer it over Face of the Mountain on Thresh.
* **Boots of Speed** - This game lasted 50 minutes and you're still sitting on Boots 1. Most upgraded boots are pretty cost efficient and provide important stats, like more move speed, auto-attack damage reduction, Tenacity, etc. Depending on each match, I generally upgrade my Boots as my 2nd or 3rd item.
* **Frozen Heart** - Good choice. The CDR is important for Thresh, and the aura effect is good against Kalista and Diana. One of my favorite items to pick up as a Support.
* **Athene's Unholy Grail** - Your worst item choice of the game. Thresh doesn't want AP, and there are much better Magic Resist items that you could have opted for that would help both you and your team. All your Mana Issues are already solved by Talisman and Frozen Heart. You're also over the CDR cap, at this point. CDR is a relatively expensive stat, so you're throwing Gold away for 10% CDR that you won't get to use.
* **Thornmail** - Probably want to avoid this one on Thresh. Since you went with Frozen Heart and Thornmail, you have a lot of pure Armor, but no Health to back it up. You need both stats to have effective tankiness. Randuin's Omen would have been better.

My build path would have been:

* Coin, Pots, Warding Totem
* Sightstone, Sweeper
* Boots, Nomad's Medalion
* **Boots of Mobility**, **Talisman** (10% CDR)
* **Upgraded Sweeper**, **Frozen Heart** (20% CDR)
* **Locket of the Iron Solari** (10% CDR)
* **Randuin's Omen**
* **Ruby Sightstone**, Elixirs

With this build, you max out at 40% CDR, you maximize your catch potential, and you provide two important auras - the enemy AS Debuff and the friendly MR buff. You're tanky enough to withstand some abuse, but you're not your team's dedicated tank. That's what Vi and Volibear are for. Let them build Thornmail while you enable your carries to do well by building more team-oriented items. "

""In my professional opinion, the easiest and most inexpensive way to get one’s B12 is to take at least 2,500 mcg (µg) of cyanocobalamin once each week, ideally as a chewable, sublingual, or liquid supplement (you can’t take too much–all you get is expensive pee).

Or, if you’d rather get into the habit of taking something daily (instead of once-a-week), I recommend at least 250mcg (I know the math doesn’t “add up” but that’s due to the vagaries of the B12 receptor system — I’ll record and upload a video showing how I arrived at these recommendations).

Or, if you’d rather get it from B12-fortified foods instead of supplements, I’d suggest three servings a day, each containing at least 25% of the “Daily Value” on its label (again, I’ll explain). Such foods can be as exotic as a certain type of “nutritional yeast” or as simple as a bowl of Cheerios.""

I've played about 20 fiora games now and while Blackcleaver is decent I would go for Brut - maybe hex - Hydra - Lucidity - Youmuus - QSS - Bt and maybe top it off with a tank item. 
If you have flat ad there's not alot of use for %arpen because you just shred tanks with your passive. Youmuus gives you the power you need to kill squishies. The sctive is extremely nice for splitting and gettig those ult procs off. It's the build I like the most but against cc heavy teams blackcleaver mercs should be fine too.
However, I think this build is harder to pull off but alot more rewarding. I've had games where my Ult did 87% of their max hp in true damage. "

I don't understand how the story is so loved. I thought that it was really underdeveloped but because it ripped so much from the first 2 games that people let it slide without realizing. The salts were kinda just there. There was no reason they were there in Columbia. In rapture they were the reason everyone was crazy. In Columbia they were crazy because of religious conviction. Comstock wouldn't even want his people to have salts to keep them under control right? Columbia didn't exist for the freedom to experiment without morality holding it back which is why the plasmids made sense in Rapture. That stupid fucking ghost boss? How do people get over that? It wasn't fun or good for the story. The messages left around were only by 3 or 4 people mostly in Infinite. There were tons and tons of characters that left messages in the prior 2 games that made the back story more full and rich. The cage or the bird? It couldn't have made less of a difference and the illusion of choice point that makes wasn't well executed. The big twist at the end was the same fucking twist as the first game. If you played the first game there's no way to not see it coming. I think people were starry eyed because the environment was pretty and they confuse that with have a really good story.

"Your interpretations more or less line up with Kip Thorne's explanations in *The Science of Interstellar*.

1. No. It is impossible to glimpse the singularity by definition, since nothing within the event horizon can move away from it. The object he encountered inside the event horizon was an entrance (separate from the singularity) that took him outside our spacetime and into the Tesseract.

2. No. The Tesseract scene plays out with a beginning, middle, and end, with past events influencing future events, therefore time is passing inside the Tesseract. However, if you were to try and compare the passage of time within the Tesseract to the passage of time in the outside universe, you'd hit a brick wall since the Tesseract exists outside our 4D spacetime.

3. No. Nolan explicitly ruled this out:

&gt; It turns out (see below) that backward time travel is governed by the laws of quantum gravity, which are terra almost incognita, so we physicists don’t know for sure what is allowed and what not. Chris made two specific choices for allowed and forbidden time travel—his rule set:

&gt; Rule 1: Physical objects and fields with three space dimensions, such as people and light rays, cannot travel backward in time from one location in our brane to another, nor can information that they carry. The physical laws or the actual warping of spacetime prevent it. This is true whether the objects are forever lodged in our brane or journey through the bulk in a three-dimensional face of a tesseract, from one point in our brane to another. So, in particular, Cooper can never travel to his own past.

&gt; Rule 2: Gravitational forces can carry messages into our brane’s past.

"I love the idea of frozen cyberpunk. I'm already designing the tie-in Lego set in my mind.

Why not work with the setting instead of against it? Don't heat your roads; invent vehicles and shoes to travel ice and gravel. Design your buildings and clothing to accommodate the hole in the ozone layer/increased UV exposure. I'd think construction materials would be your biggest problem in building skyscrapers, but you might also consider how frozen the ground is and the difficulty of digging into it for firm foundations. (You should totally work around this somehow, because the idea of a glittering Antarctic cityline at night is fantastic.)

As far as World War III: most of the long-term health impact would be borne by the same areas targeted by the bombs. Keep in mind that the greater the initial devastation, the fewer people will be around to get leukemia and thyroid cancer in 30 years. This is because the radioactive fallout does decay over time, and so by the time it's carried to the southern hemisphere (you listed northern cities) it's significantly *less* radioactive. Your major long-term health effects are cancer (esp thyroid) and birth defects in the next generation. There will also likely be an increase in melanoma due to temporary (5-10 years?) ozone layer depletion, which will also be MUCH greater in the north than in the south (the Antarctic ozone hole is a fact of life, alas).

One note--10 years of nuclear winter is probably not realistic. Maybe 3-4?

HOWEVER. The giant caveat in all of this is that we don't know how the explosion of that many nukes in a short time frame would affect global weather patterns. So you have some flexibility there."

"They are the same. The official name of the disorder is [Antisocial personality disorder.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisocial_personality_disorder)

&gt;**Psychopathy (/saɪˈkɒpəθi/), also known as—though sometimes distinguished from—sociopathy** (/soʊsiˈɒpəθi/), is traditionally defined as a personality disorder characterized by enduring antisocial behavior, diminished empathy and remorse, and disinhibited or bold behavior.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy

&gt;There are various contemporary usages of the term. Robert Hare claimed in the popular science book entitled Snakes in Suits that sociopathy and psychopathy are often used interchangeably, but in some cases the term sociopathy is preferred because it is less likely than is psychopathy to be confused with psychosis, whereas in other cases which term is used may ""reflect the user's views on the origins and determinates of the disorder"". **Hare contended that the term sociopathy is preferred by those that see the causes as due to social factors and early environment, and the term psychopathy preferred by those who believe that there are psychological, biological, and genetic factors** involved in addition to environmental factors.[83]"

"It's a classical logical fallacy known as ""God of the gaps"". Meaning: anything that we don't yet understand, we just ascribe to God. Bonhoeffer wrote:

&gt;how wrong it is to use God as a stop-gap for the incompleteness of our knowledge. If in fact the frontiers of knowledge are being pushed further and further back (and that is bound to be the case), then God is being pushed back with them, and is therefore continually in retreat. We are to find God in what we know, not in what we don't know. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps

It's a logical fallacy because the existence of God is neither proven by the fact that gaps in knowledge exist, nor disproven when human knowledge increases.

&gt;For we know in part and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away. When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known. ( 1 Cor 13.9-12)

&gt;“For My thoughts are not your thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways,” says the LORD.
“For as the heavens are higher than the earth, So are My ways higher than your ways, And My thoughts than your thoughts. (Is. 55.8-9)"

"Don't be discouraged, it takes awhile to get the feel of it. I'm not sure what you specifically want to work on, but I suggest that you try to see where your FC wants to go, and try to push the enemies strategically out of the way. If you are able to, find boosts that your FC doesn't need to use in order to execute a boost block, which your FC can easily dance around and proceed towards the goal zone. Just keep practicing different approaches to blocking, and surely you'll discover new ways to help out your FC!

"Yup. Portland usually gets fairly light rain (small drops,) that don't show up on camera. Most movies/shows have to use rain trucks to produce big/heavy rain so it actually appears on screen. If you watch Grimm, and pay attention closely, you will often see that it actually is raining, but you can only tell by seeing water hitting car windshields or puddles. Quickly looking, it looks like it just ""rained recently"" rather than actively raining. That's also why actors get DRENCHED when it's raining in the scene - because to see the rain, it has to be coming down HARD. "

"schoenberg talks about deceptive cadences in more or less the same way i have in theory of harmony. 

most online music sources are heavily lacking in harmony; only covering a minimum.  

&gt; While it might be used that way, it is not strictly pertinent to what we are discussing.

i suppose, but they are, in a way, part of the ending.

&gt; deceptive cadence is understood to mean the substitution for the expected progression, V - I, of the progressions V - VI or V - IV. this is the original form: I is expected after V, but it does not come; VI or IV come instead. but I is expected after V only at the close, in an authentic cadence; since I does not come, it is then not yet the close, rather only a deceptive cadence. A possibility of closing is set up, but not used. the effect is naturally quite strong; for the deceptive cadence creates the possibility of preparing the actual close again and, through the repetition, of ending with increased power. 

- schoenberg, theory of harmony

the roman numerals are all upper case in theory of harmony. in this example they represent the unaltered scale degrees of the major, or the harmonic minor. 

he later explains, for both the authentic and deceptive cadence, that the V^7 chord is often used instead of V, and vii° can be interpreted as the V^7 chord with it's root missing.

"In the UK they do credit cards that pretty much anyone can get, but have a huge APR and tiny limit. If you have no credit history then you have to post them proof of identity. Just look up what credit cards they are in your country, in the UK it's Aqua and capital one. Set up a direct debit to pay it off in full and use it each month. Build up from there.


An other method of getting a credit history is a bank account setup for people on benefits. In the UK there is one called Halifax Saver, again Google is your friend, they have shitty benefits, but again it's just for your credit file and you need no credit history to get it.

The last method is mail order companies, these go on your credit file, but they are hard to find these days as everyone buys things online. In the UK Next clothing still do one. Just by an item of clothing and it adds to your credit history.

Make sure you are on the electoral register, this improves your credit history even though it isn't credit, they like to know you are who you say you are. You could just be making up a name if you have no credit history, but if you are on the electoral register that shows on your credit file.

I even get that people don't realize that a small percentage of terrible people are hiding behind the anonymity of ""peaceful protesters"" like cowards, so they can come out at night and cause hell. What I *don't* get, AT ALL, is how anyone can say that this little girl, whose skin color doesn't fucking mean a damn thing, ""deserved it"".

Even if people are trolling, or being stupid, I really can't fathom that anyone could be so callous and cruel as to say a little girl deserved to be shot to death."

My wife felt it too and told me to make myself cum for her and when she sensed I was close to cumming she told me to take a breath and then she pushed until the head popped into my throat again except this time she didn't stop and pushed the dildo all the way down my throat and then began thrusting in and out. I remember the room spinning and everything starting to go black. Last thing I remember was feeling my cum hitting me in the face. 

I regained my senses and realized I could breath again and looked up at my wife smiling at me. She asked me if I could handle her doing that while Kay (her friend) fucks me. I nodded. She said she would see if her friend wants to do it tomorrow night.

"Depends on how it is done. If it is paid in full without any caps, sure, that might be a concern, but if only a portion of the rent is payed proportionally (which also gets capped above a certain rent) and the rest is taken from a flat UBI income, you can equalize some of the variance in rent without removing the incentive to keep the rent low.

"Look at my username, you can guess where I stand on this issue.

The problem is most people do not understand how the Bible was compiled. It's not like the Quran, it didn't fall out of the sky prepackaged. The only material in the New Testament is very early writings and completely consistent. The apocryphal writings, such as the Gnostic Gospels, are often even centuries late and do not fit logically. You also have to remember that some manuscripts back then are lost now. Furthermore, the books came out of a culture of very strict oral tradition, which could be maintained accurately for a very long time, and these writings are very early for an oral tradition to be recorded.

Furthermore, as mentioned, other contemporary historians make note about Jesus and/or Christianity."

"Recency ""bias"" is perfectly fine, it's just critical thinking. After miom 2014 rankings I argued that leffen was better than mew2king and hbox, due to significantly better W-L in ntsc. Everyone screamed ""recency bias"" because apparently improvment in your results is most likely ""variance"" which doesn't really exist in the conventional sense in melee.

Leffen won beast 5 right after, and is now the player to beat = )

Plup went from giving up being a samus main to beating leffen, mango and hbox in 6 months (as well as positive results vs non gods.)

Going from losing to swedish delight at apex, to switching characters and trading sets with top 15 players as a new character (including hbox), to barely losing to mango and leffen, to beating mango and leffen. Is it really that difficult or rediculous to see the pattern? Not saying it's going to continue, but improvement is a real thing. Some people fall off, some people improve just enough to stay where they are, and some people improve at a faster rate than everyone else. "

"Massage therapist/Esthetician here. The grossest thing I've personally dealt with isn't necessarily a ""thing"". It's super heavy smokers. Once the massage lotion gets worked in, the smell just seeps out of their entire body and fills the small, closed room I'm trapped in for an hour. I just gotta power through it and hope my room airs out before my next client. If you do smoke, please wash your hands before the service because they always smell the strongest. Maybe try to hold off on smoking for like an hour before your massage. When it's faint I have no problem with it, but sometimes it's like I've been teleported into an ash tray. And this is coming from someone who smokes half a pack every day after work.


Edit: I also do waxing, including bikini and Brazilian waxes. Ladies, if your feminine area is going to be stewing in your undies all day at the office before you come see me please bring some baby wipes or ask me for one, because vaginas SMELL. They just do and most of us would rather not be overwhelmed by it. That being said, I've never been grossed out by the way a vagina looks, so try not to be self conscious. No one is judging you, we're just ripping out your hair and sending you on your way.


Edit 2: I don't think heavy smokers are gross. It's just the smell. It's a horrible addiction that's hard to break and they deserve a good massage or facial just like anyone else. I did not mean to pass judgement on smokers or women with smelly vaginas. I have a vagina and an addiction to nicotine and am only trying to offer tips for anyone with either of these."

"&gt;The reason why not paying taxes is bad isn't because you should give money you don't need, it's because you should give back to the society that made your money making possible and ensure it strive and stay stable so others have the same opportunity.

The two seem rather the same things. If giving to society is an ethical requirement, you should give back even if you don't need to pay taxes.

&gt;So do you think law enforcement is a government waste ?

I didn't say that. Certainly some law enforcement activities are wasteful, and some are not. The question, as always, is whether additional funding would be more effective going to policing or other things. And I don't trust a government to get that right. The question they ask is ""who has the bigger lobby/voter base/etc"", not "" who's most effective""."
"Lividity evidence is pretty clear. Blood pools in specific parts of the body after death based on the orientation of the body. Hae was found buried on her side. Lividity was found on her front. Front lividity indicates her body was lying facedown when lividity was fixed. Lividity is fixed after around 8 hours in normal cases, longer if the air was cold (which is was slightly on 13 Jan). If Hae was buried on her side at 7pm, the blood would have pooled on that side. Therefore, Hae was not buried at 7pm. 8 hours after her murder, her body must have been resting facedown. Some have attempted to claim Jay simply lied about the burial but was with Adnan to dump Hae's body face down at 7pm and they came back later. This however contradicts his entire story of the remainder of the night - spent disposing of shovels with Jenn. His 2015 interview is an attempt to testify to scientifically correct facts - a midnight burial is doable even with a front lividity pattern. However, for reason's i've looked at previously, the dumping theory doesnt make sense. "

"I don't have a problem with zero rating as long as the same deal is offered to all companies.

If one company can buy their way out of caps, or cover the cost ad-hoc (toll-free data) then I think it opens up other possibilities for business models which benefit the consumer. So as long as all companies can get in on it I have no problem with it. At least so far.

I think companies should be able to pay their data onto a different tier (cap) and speed rating. A company that (for example) sells a remote backup service could buy bulk amounts of data from ISPs at higher throughput than your usual speed rating (say 150mbit instead of 25) by agreeing to use it (or 90% of it) between 2 and 6AM for example.

Thus a backup company could reach customers who would benefit from (and pay for) their service but are too cheap to buy a high enough speed tier/cap to make it feasible."

As a DK, there is no greater pleasure in this world (at least for me) than some snooty Marth fairing your shield thinking he's spaced well enough to avoid getting up-B'd and then nailing the SDI input inward so you can get the strong hit.

Complexes, on the other hand, I do at least twice a week, after lifting, as a finisher. I cut out upright rows since my traps started exploding too much, though. I also do 2 sets of 5 reps of the complex with the 45# bar as a warmup before squats or deadlifts. God, I love complexes.

"Why oh god why doesn't Riot utilize more of cloudflare's services? Cloudflare has contracts with Softlayer (EAL Agreement) and Rackspace. Coupled with content caching, their is no reason that any person from any metro location should not be able to achieve an extremely reasonable connection.

For a company that advertises how well it performs, they sure do onsistently skim on infrastructure and security. They are reactive rather than proactive. 

I'd imagine this is because the controllers/people who decide where the money goes either come from a strict developer background, or quite frankly, the infrastructure team just isn't doing their job. 

Obviously every company is different, and their has to be some good reason...I hope, but I've consulted for some of the largest companies in the world and sometimes you just find out that they simply don't want to spend the money. When Riot is so concerned about customer satisfaction, I find this hard to believe. "

"&gt; they believe that game is more important than looks . According to my experiences this is wrong.

Game gets more emphasis because game is far more cost effective to develop than looks. Most AFCs have shit tier game. They might be pudgy too, but their game is fucking awful. If game were looks they'd be 400 pounders sprinkled with Cheeto dust and sweat. Game is also harder to get started on because you need to put yourself out there.

The wall for looks hits men too. It's just softer for them because mens' looks don't degrade as fast as womens', and men have other factors besides. Women are mostly Looks in terms of SMV. Men are Looks, Money, Status, Game. As a man ages Looks tends to go down (exceptions for former betas who were really ugly young) while Money, Status, and Game tend to go up.

For the long term men should invest in Looks to not look bad. They should invest in Money, Status, and Game because those all keep improving."

"Yes, I think I understand arrays now (thanks to you!), but if I understand this correctly this would play a fixed playlist of songs in the same order every time. What I want is to play a fixed playlist of songs in a random order. So if there were 5 songs, it could play 1,2,3,4,5 or 3,2,5,1,4 etc. but it would never do 5,5,3,1,3, which is what happens if I just use a random() or a choose().

Also, a signed contract is a signed contract.  There's no such thing as ""duress' in the case of a wedding.  Duress is if you hold a gun to someones head or threaten them with violence.

"&gt; I initially thought that your use of FMIL stood for ""my fucking mother in law"".

Yes, much more appropriate at the moment. Maybe after I get married I'll keep using it and it'll be my little passive aggressive secret and I'll tell people that it means my *fabulous* mother in law. :P

Yeah, sometimes I like to say it's a neurological disorder (since I believe it is neurological, and then I don't have to explain how I have a totally different unrelated illness that caused my nerve damage). I just don't think my FMIL particularly cares. She's the sort of person who thinks she knows everything, and you can't explain anything to her. They are all effectively seagulls.

"&gt;The whole 'war on women' is simply rhetoric and there are plenty of women who vote republican and conservative. 

Yes, among white women, it's pretty close to even.  The problem then is that the overwhelming majority of minority women push the female vote well into the favor of the left.  

&gt;Most 'devout' democrats become more conservative with age,

Well, if current population trends continue (which they have for some time), younger populations grow at a larger rate than older populations.  So if youth tends to vote liberal while older tends to vote conservative, the conservatives will be eternally outnumbered.  

&gt;this administration and the previous one already stepped into steaming piles of shit 

The conservatives had the election in the bag after Obama's first term if they just could have found someone who had an inkling of a liberal idea or could have backed off from the religious right.  I'd say they're in the same position right now, but all the candidates that can do it are getting slammed for not being conservative enough, which is stupid.  In the primary, it's better to hitch your wagon to the guy more people will vote for than to the guy who's more super conservative.  Votes win elections, not ideas.  "

"I know the day you release a game on Steam is very very important, but how important is the release on itch.io? Does it generate a spike in traffic? Is it newsworthy? Does the media care?  

The reason I ask is because my game is in an open beta right now and I'm looking to get some feedback from players. It'll be paid on Steam, but while in beta is currently free. I'm thinking it might be smart to release the beta onto itch.io now, get some feedback from the beta, and then release on Steam later. But I'm hesitant to do this because it might be better to ""double down"" by releasing on itch, Steam and everywhere else on the exact same day. To maximize hype and whatnot.  

Does anyone have any thoughts or experience with this? When you released your game onto itch.io what impact did you notice?"

"Why should you pay more in property taxes just because more people want to buy your property?  Your business isn't necessarily making more money just because there is more demand for the land it's on now.  Doesn't that actually HELP businesses?  If a small business owns property, and the assessed value goes up, they may not be able to keep it, and would have to sell out.  It could put little competitors out of business quick.  Why are taxes based on assessed value anyways?  

Why not take the budget you need for the managed area (county or city, or what ever), divide that up over the number of acres in the area, and change each person an amount based on how many acres they have.   In my city  it would be $2365 per acre.  We are currently charged $15.50 per $1000 of value on the property. Which is about $2050 for my quarter acre lot.   It would even help residents in lower income areas.  The bottom end of the market in my area is about $50,000 for a house, which is currently taxed at $750 a year, but going per acre, would be $590.

Just seems silly to me that my neighbor and I could have the same size lot, the same house design, but if I redo my siding, or finish my basement and increase the value of my house, suddenly I have to pay more than the neighbors in taxes."

Anyways he never did it again and to this day still apologizes and said it's what his pop did to him. It made him Mad and sick in his mind.

"All families teach their children different views on drugs, life, sex, etc.

You can't change the minds of most but you can change the changeable and malleable. Be a responsible drug user. Show, those who will listen, the therapeutic sides of things like psychedelics and chemicals. Don't get angry when they reject or try to degrade your character for using substances. It's their closed mind or strong ties to their upbringing that keep them from thinking otherwise and there is nothing necessarily wrong with that.

They all do it too. They just happen to be legal. Some take SSRIs, benzos, antihistimines, coffee, etc. etc. 

But you know what? Our generation and generations coming up are becoming anti-drug war, pro-legalization, decriminalization etc.

I'm a republican for god's sake (well, possibly leaning more libertarian on most issues) but if you want true freedom of choice, work on limiting your government and allowing those to truly have the freedom our country was supposedly founded upon (this is a US based comment obviously).

"hm...I just answered a question about a hype man for u/FlippantSandwich , and right after posting I thought ""wait, a splash of gunslinger would give this build a something extra"". I warn you it is a very silly build, and no spells. You are forewarned.

The cheese is that there's a Monk archetype that gives Wis-based bardic performance that bestows ki-powered class features to allies, and another archetype that stacks and gives panache, whilst also linking panache to ki; you can then dip into gunslinger to get grit (which combines with panache) and into the sleuth artchetype of investigator to gain a luck pool, all the while being VMC bard to gain an independent, cha-based bardic performance ability (which can also be oratory-based). Mercifully, that first archetype I mentioned also grants Wis to hit, reducing the intrinsic MADness of monks. You end up with a very scrappy dude with a sword cane and a junky pistol, which are less dangerous than his fists. The fists, in turn, are a lot less dangerous than his mouth, and all the weird stuff he narrates for the people around him. Oh, did I mention he wears a bath (monk's) robe and a gaudy hat with ostrich plumes (of panache)?

"I like something that's kinda in-between. 

I want something kinda luxurious but I don't need something that's a true luxury car. Top level trims of regular sedans are good enough for me, or the next step up ('premium' cars are built just for people like me - things like the lower end Lexus models, most of the Acura lineup, low end BMWs like the 2 series and things like the MB CLA as well as most Volvo models). But I won't buy something like a base model 3 series or a 5 series. 

I'm an enthusiast for cars I can actually afford, and I'm interested in all the drivetrain tech and other tech, and I want reasonably good handling. But I don't need track star handling. In fact, I don't go to the track and have no aspirations to do so. I don't think that disqualifies me from being an enthusiast. 

Besides, most of the roads are highways around here, in the flat prairie. No twisties to speak of whatsoever. Barely any hills. My handling fun is limited to onramps and offramps pretty much. In that scenario, a bare-bones performance car makes 0 sense. I could maybe justify a Mustang (2015+) as there's lots of straight lines to go fast in and the interior isn't too bad (on the GT Premium of course - anything less is a no-go).

We propose a greedy mixture reduction algorithm which is capable of pruning
mixture components as well as merging them based on the Kullback-Leibler
divergence (KLD). The algorithm is distinct from the well-known Runnalls' KLD
based method since it is not restricted to merging operations. The capability
of pruning (in addition to merging) gives the algorithm the ability of
preserving the peaks of the original mixture during the reduction. Analytical
approximations are derived to circumvent the computational intractability of
the KLD which results in a computationally efficient method. The proposed
algorithm is compared with Runnalls' and Williams' methods in two numerical
examples, using both simulated and real world data. The results indicate that
the performance and computational complexity of the proposed approach make it
an efficient alternative to existing mixture reduction methods.

"It can be. But this argument is incorrect. Genocide is a form of population tactics, but not all population tactics are genocide.

There is a very clear difference between what happened in Rwanda and what is happening in Israel. Genocides are extremely energy intensive, short in duration, and brutal on an industrial scale. That is not happening in Israel. There are no mass graves, or mass crematoriums for human bodies. 

To call what is happening in Israel genocide is a gross disservice to those who have lived through the Khmer Rouge and the Ukranian Holodomor. Emotions are high on this issue, and that's completely understandable, but casually throwing out terms like genocide waters down the definition and eventually destroys its meaning.

"Hi to you too!'
The 'Koori' thing is probably a bit 'PC', but is definately the 'prefered term', and what the people call themselves, mostly. Its a bit tricky coz- like in many countries there are many 'First Nations' or ""tribes"" so there's kinda different terms in different regions- Murri in NSW/Qld, Yolngu up north. But 'Koori's is kinda becoming accepted as covering all Aboriginals. Its kind of a PC minefield, with a lot of ""I identify as___"", ""This terms kinda offensive"", ""this isnt"" etc. flying around in some circles. As I'm sure you can Imagine, this can piss off ppl who have problems with aboriginals. But generally people are cool with 'Aboriginal' or whatever (apart from the ""A"" word, or similar), if its used respectfully. I'm just used to 'Koori' coz of where I live (Melb).

Its a shame you got that impression about Australia. Like anywhere there are some idiots, and IMO some ppl can say dumb stuff coz they have little experience/understanding of 'race' stuff, are not good at empathy, but often that changes when they speak face-to-face with whatever race and see they're reasonable, normal people.

Generally Australians (apart from a small but vocal minority) are very accepting of whatever race. I rarely see racist abuse or whatever, and almost never have overt racism directed at me (but I do live in a pretty 'diverse', 'PC' area). When racism does happen on the street, or in the media, people will speak out, and nobodies going to side wit the racist- not in public, anyway.

&gt;It's the hidden stuff that causes the most damage from what I can tell.

This is very astute- spot on! The few vocal idiots using racist slurs and posting stupid crap on facebook are obnoxious, but pretty inconsequential in the big picture (in Australia, or wherever). The bigger issue is the subtle, unspoken stuff that people (often from basically well-meaning people) don't even realise they're doing. Some people hate to hear this, but there's [no shortage of studies](http://www.cracked.com/article_21822_5-studies-that-prove-racism-still-way-worse-than-we-think.html) showing treating people worse because of race can be instinctive, unconcious and basically universal. I think the biggest problem regarding racism is all of us thinking 'racism' is about the moron posting anti-Islamic stuff or whining about ""The Blacks"" or ""The Jews""- but really treating people worse because of race is something I can do, we all can do, without even realising. (Same goes for gender)(hate to be all preachy and SJW, but what can you do?)

So whats your take on the 'Confederate' flag thing? Do you think some people really see the flag as not a symbol of white supremacy? Or is it a bit of ""*you* can't tell *us* what to do"" that's making people not want to ban it or whatever? Also- Do you think people assume you'll be racist because you're from the South? Do you think, in general, that stereotype about Southerners being more likely to be racist has any truth (not you obviously. You sound very nice.)? Do you see much overt racism where you live?

By this I feel that people should be have freedom in determining who they are and that people should be able to freely choose and exercise a religion so long as it doesn't infringe on the quality of life of people (e.g. religiously justified homophobia should be illegal because it makes other peoples lives worse). I also believe strongly in closing the wage gap be it the gender, race, sexuality, etc based. I'd say some of this philosophy stems from my religion but most of it stems from the friends I made in high school and finding out more about feminist and lgbtqia+ activism from what they mentioned."

I don't think this organization ""Project Semicolon"" can copyright the semicolon. If you want to use it, what's stopping you?

Why would it need to be tattooed on you? Couldn't you use it some other way, like on a T-shirt, or a piece of jewelry, or a plastic bracelet?

Do you really know how to help people who are contemplating suicide? Don't you think it would be a good idea to have some training?

There probably are some secular organizations out there that would give you some training. Try here: http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/getinvolved/locator.aspx

They would probably also give you some advice about the best way to go about helping people. Maybe they have volunteer opportunities where you could work under their supervison. It doesn't hurt to ask.

I actually went ahead and bought Toy Story 2 for N64 along with a Dazzle capture card on Amazon a few days ago and should be here by this weekend. Hopefully I'll be able to get everything working properly and should be streaming this weekend! 
I would love to watch a tutorial video of some kind, though I'm probably gonna do a blind run or two just to get re-acquainted with the game. My Twitch is http://twitch.tv/HotWafflez. (I also streamed Kirby 64 once, as you might be able to tell.)

"""asking ""why"" is a never ending pit of more whys.""

By that logic, should Newton have avoided asking why apples fall from trees? Asking why will indeed result in more whys, and we'll investigate those new whys until we find one that we don't know the answer to. You (and perhaps Feynman, I don't know, he discovered some great physics but that doesn't make him an oracle) apparently believe that as soon as we hit that boundary, we should give up the inquiry. I think we should admit that we don't know, keep trying to find out, and understand that each discovery will always prompt more investigation. I also think it's *okay* if there are physics questions that we will never ultimately know the answer to. It doesn't mean the questions are *invalid*, it just means that we'll never have the vantage point or be able to conduct the right experiment to find out.

Incidentally, why *does* the fundamental nature of the universe have to be ""just because""? Why can't it be an infinite regress of reasons stacked on top of reasons? How do you know it's the former and not the latter?"

I don't see how trying to shoot down the people who are trying to help change this country for the better is doing much service here. If you want to just bitch and wait around for 5 to 10 years that's not going to help the problem out much now is it? Like I said, his main focus is to get people involved in politics. We have to start somewhere. There's nothing wrong with what he is doing and he has already inspired many people to get focused and educate themselves on what needs to be done to change things. These people then attempt to do what they can to get their country back and it can go from there. Most people know they don't want almost all of the countries wealth to go to a select few individuals and they don't feel they should be second class citizens behind those with millions. They just don't properly understand how to fix it or are too jaded to try. With his leadership we can get many more people realizing what they need to do or not do to get everything back in order."

"I've been running my SuperTank nonstop since I received it. 

I used the .2 ohm coil with Max vg juice and this thing is unbelievable. 

I've stopped damn near all my usage of the Herakles, Arctic and ST Mini. 

I still use them throughout the day but not like my SuperTank. 

I've been Vaping from 40-50 watts with not a single damn dry hit. Flavor is fantastic and vapor production is more than I'd ever need. I'm 100% satisfied with this thing.

My favorite feature is the insanely easy top fill. It's just ridiculous how simple it is and every damn Subohm tank needs to adopt this system. 

That being said the tank is a motherfucker to take apart. Ha ha. Just changed my coil today and it was hell getting it apart because of the enormous AFC. It's difficult to get a grip on the two pieces of the tank. 


I'm actively searching for the SuperTank Mini because I want to see how much better the flavor gets with a shorter chimney. It also has more juice fill ports that are also larger and the drip tip looks to be better. 


Either way full size or mini I've not been this satisfied with a tank outright since I got my first Lemo. 


All of my tanks I enjoy, but this one is both phenomenal and the easiest to use.

There's a good reason why I saw hardline on sale for 20 dollars a few months ago. And battlefield 4 on sale for 40. There's a huge content diffrence. 4 just is so much bigger, better, and has balanced gameplay. Hardline has none of that. And I did give it it's fair shake, I really did! And I wanted it to be good so bad! But it was a huge letdown..... battlefield 4 on the other hand! I preordered that, and have not stopped playing it since. I love that game! It's my favorite shooter of all time, and on the short list of my favorite games of all time period. 

Also, bf4 is getting updated with a ton of free content soon. Our favorite vanilla maps are being remade into night versions that play very well, our favorite maps in the battlefield franchise are being remastered in the new game engine. AND the community has been building a map with the developers to make the best battlefield map ever made. Working with them every step of the way. Since before they added in any textures. And all of that is going to be 100% absolutely free. All of this is thanks to the efforts of the Community Test Environment which you can help with if you get premium. 

Battlefield 4 over Hardline all day every day no question."

&gt; Frank Henenlotter's BASKET CASE 2 picks up right where the original BASKET CASE leaves off. After surviving the fall from their hotel room window, Duane Bradley and his misshapen, basket-dwelling brother Belial are taken to the city hospital. By now, their attempt at leading a secret life is blown, and the pair have become media darlings across the country. Meanwhile, Duane's long-lost Aunt learns of their situation and, along with her pregnant daughter Susan, helps them escape from the confines of the hospital and the eye of the press. Duane and Belial's aunt, known as Granny Ruth, takes them under her wing at her mansion, which serves as a safe haven for hideously deformed freaks of all shapes and sizes. Unfortunately, the whereabouts of this dynamic duo don't remain secret for too long, and Duane and Belial team up with Susan, Granny Ruth, and her houseful of mutants to devise a plan to do away with the exploitative reporters once and for all.
(*IMDb*)

**Critical reception:**
&gt; Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 67% of six surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 6\.4\/10\. Variety called it ""a hilarious genre spoof"" that pays homage to Freaks. Caryn James of The New York Times wrote, ""As cheap horror spoofs go, this one isn't all bad."" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote, ""It has everything it needs to become the cult film that its 1982 predecessor has been\: outrageous dark humor, bizarre horror, driving energy and genuine pathos.""

"True.  I agree that this term, and most others here, can be used in a bunch of applications - and you make a good point that the word had meaning before it had a specific definition in the sciences.  But, I'd argue that when we're talking about a biological process, using scientific terms makes sense, and in that context there is a right and a wrong use of those terms.  If we're talking linguistics, we can go on and on about words evolving, adapting word meanings to new uses, etc.  When we're talking animals _acclimating_ to a new habitat, then saying that the rabbit adapted to its new pen is incorrect.

&gt;Well, I didn't go into a lot of detail about how Bernie managed to do the stomping. In his first election, he put together groups as varied as the Burlington Police Department union, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, several local neighborhood groups, some church groups, non-profit childcare centers, people who wanted a bike path (it's a really cool bike path, too), low income housing advocates, and probably a sewing circle and woodworking club.
Once elected, he ran directly against the City Council that was blocking his program, campaigned to oust the Aldermen who were causing trouble (using the same network that had grown up in his election, which he had carefully maintained and continued speaking to), and eventually took over the Council - or at least showed them it was a good idea to support his programs.

&gt;**Bernie has made the point repeatedly that he believes Obama's big mistake was not maintaining the coalition he had created to get elected**, but instead deciding to work behind the scenes to build alliances inside Congress - and the Republicans had no intention of building any alliances. **If Obama had maintained his organization, and assuming he was still popular two years into his first term, he might have been able to generate enough electoral energy to oust, or even give a good scare to, his opponents.** This would probably have led to a slightly more conciliatory attitude among all congresscritters. After all, ""The prospect of getting hanged in a fortnight concentrates the mind wonderfully"", and politicians really, really like being re-elected.

&gt;FDR swept in a Congress that supported him. I don't think Bernie will do that, although it's possible. But FDR also pushed to elect members of Congress during the midterm elections (with LBJ funneling oil money to supporters which didn't hurt one bit), and the coat-tail effect worked.

&gt;Now, it may be that coat-tails no longer exist - we seem as a nation to prefer divided government recently - but even a few incumbents losing their seats because Obama campaigned against them personally would have been educational. ""Pour encourager les autres"", as it were.

&gt;Granted, it's a high risk strategy, but by golly, it's so crazy it might actually work!

One little tip with this -- applicable to other factions as well, though a little less relevant on Silver since Wave 10 is the only time you can get 2 Banshees at once and Wave 11 is the only unlimited Banshee wave:

If you want to minimize the number of Banshees you fight, try to save them for last.  3 Marauders or 4 Cannibals are worth 1 Banshee in the wave budget.  Of course that means kiting her around for most of the wave (and hoping she doesn't teleport through a wall and grab you as you're killing something else), but that helps your chances of not having a second Banshee spawn once you've killed the first one."

"Spotters are almost always athletes themselves.  They are most likely not competing on the same level and same yearly schedule of these people though.  The odds of a spotter getting hurt instead of the athlete are pretty high.  After all, you are using your body to prevent another person from crashing to the ground.  Instead, they crash into you.So if somebody is due to compete soon, chances are, they won't be spotting.  Also, if you want to spot of a high level competition you need to attend seminars and get licensed.  Source: Did gymnastics for 10 years and was a spotter for 4 years  (retired due to injuries)."

"""I would rule as a chief executive. I would not answer to a board of directors or any other entity. Nothing to impede progress. If you want to see the fate of democracies, look out the windows.

Autocracies aren't inherently evil and democracies aren't inherently good. The NCR's war with the Legion was initially impeded because their veteran rangers were ""chasing ghosts"" in Baja. Caesar wouldn't allow his veteran soldiers to do the bidding of a corrupt senator. Caesar's actions are highly questionable to put it meekly, but his ruthless efficiency is definitely a good trait."

"Moose has been falsely accused of hacking / cheating in H1Z1 which is just absurdly rediculous. Anyone who knows Moose would know he is a legitimate player and not only that but genuinely a nice guy. For someone to dedicate so much time and money towards H1Z1 to just run hacks and get banned after hundreds and hundreds of hours just doesn't make sense. I have been playing with RDxMoose for many months now and I can definitely say he's got that potato aim. He's respected in the community both in and outside of the H1Z1 division.

Personally as leader of the H1Z1 division for Reborn Dominion my #1 concern is hackers, both outside and people attempting to become a part of our community and use hacks. Since my watch not a single player among our ranks has been a hacker. We have multiple streamers in our division and almost anyone who can use some kind of recording software, does.

Our community is dedicated to helping remove hackers from H1Z1 and we have on multiple occasions. If any of you seen the ban message ""okokimnext"" has been banned for cheating and something about him being a potato... That was our communities most recent ban via video evidence. 

So I say again, RDxMoose just isn't a hacker.

I personally think that their ability to turn a profit should be limited somewhat.  They have to make money to satisfy shareholders and be able to build the expensive projects to meet increasing energy demands, but there is no need for them to make tons and tons of money when they have the market cornered.

"To add to this and make it more relevant to Renaissance, Raphael was fairly prolific at using his students to paint parts/large parts and even whole paintings in his name. 

At the height of his popularity he took on an incredible amount of contracts for his workshhop, to the extent that his only contribution to a work might be the design. He also tended to do it in instances where he did not have he adaquate skills.

For example, Raphael won the commission to do the interior for the Chigi Chapel in Rome. He would have done the design but the sculptues he designed were by Lorenzetto, some later ones by Bernini and Vasari writes that the frescoes were, at least, in part done by Timoteo Viti.

Other examples are 'Coronation of Charlemagne' and 'Battle of Ostia' in the Stanze di Rafaello which were definitely designed by him but look like they have had ~5 different artists actually work on them.

Sometimes it meant the quality wasn't quie as good ie. when you look at the Foritude (lower left) part of 'Cardinal Virtues' in Stanza della Segnatura the quality looks worse than the other parts. Suggestions that this was done by Penni and the other parts by Raphael himself.

This approach varied a lot from artist to artist but the main point is when we look back and try to allocate paintings to artists we skip over the fact that a lot of these works were done by their workshops. Many Raphael's may actually be 'Romano's' or Penni's etc. This isn't restricted to Raphael, as it was fairly common, but he is one of the one's I know most about so I focused on him. .

Unfortunately I don' have much info on the prices a master could command.

The Black community is well known for having their own traditions and cultural identities that are drastically different than other races which for a period of time was a way to carve out their own social identity and I understand that, but take the Hip Hop culture for instance, and everything that goes along with that i.e. chains, rims, sagging pants, World Star Hip Hop, blowing money on stupid stuff,making fun of people for ""talking white"" aka speaking with intelligence, song lyrics about rape, murder, dealing drugs and beating people, there is the ""knock out game"" which people go up to random people and just hit them as hard as they can trying to knock them out.

"&gt;that the approval rating for Democrats in Congress currently sits at 18%,

You are misrepresenting that stat, or at least phrasing it wrong.

That 18% number is not the approval rating of ""Democrats *in* Congress"". They asked citizens who identified as Democrats if they approve of how congress as a whole is doing it's job. 

Unsurprisingly, with the GOP in control of the house and the senate, Democrats are less happy with congress than Republicans are. It is not a clear statement on how they feel about the Democrats in office right now.

&gt;Ignoring the fact that Bernie is an independent, not a Democrat

I think don't know if this is necessarily a good thing for him. In the end, he has to win over Democrats. His outsider role may be appealing to a lot of people, but there is a large entrenched group of democrats already heavily involved in the party and probably less keen on wholesale change. This will be something he will have to work hard to overcome."

"&gt;The hobbies I do have are boring ones, like drawing and coding.

I think those are awesome hobbies.  Girls who code are wicked cool, and girls who do both art and code are like mythic creatures who somehow combine left and right brain stuff.

&gt;I'm kinda pudgy and I'm NOT funny. 

Aren't we all?

&gt;I worry about everything. It's hard for me to ""let loose"" at parties or even introduce myself to new people.

That's kind of normal.... it's just more intense for people with anxiety disorders.

&gt;Oh, and I'm stupid as fuck - I have no common sense at all.

Yeah, well, you're 17.  It comes with age.

&gt;I was bullied as a kid and have a strained relationship with both of my parents so I just never had a good self-esteem.

This is a common theme with anxious and depressed folks.  Somewhere, somehow you have to begin the process of denying these bullies their power over your thoughts.

&gt; I'm also depressed and angry most of the time.

Anxiety and depression are often comorbid conditions.  They become kind of a feedback loop.  That's why somewhere, somehow you have to stick a wrench into the machinery in your mind and stop the feedback loop.

&gt;I can't help but go a day without thinking of killing myself.

Do you have a pet?  Pets can serve as a short-term mood elevator and can give you some purpose for a little while.  (Until meds and/or therapy start kicking in).

&gt;I constantly think he deserves someone smarter, sexier, and more interesting.

That's not your concern.  What others think about us is none of our business.  When someone chooses to form a close relationship with us, it's like a wonderful gift.  We can't make it happen, and we can't force it to stay.  It's *their* choice to hold you in high esteem, and why they do so isn't your concern.  Trust me though, there's more than one reason.  People don't form close connections unless there's more than one reason to do so.

Keep working on the therapy.  Be honest with your therapist, and do exactly what he/she tells you.  You'll get there.  It just takes time and work."

"Green Bay's latest, greatest quarterback just wrapped up his second MVP campaign at 31 years of age. Despite some big numbers—4,381 passing yards and 38 touchdowns and 5 interceptions —he didn't lead the league in any volume statistics. Of course, those didn't win Rodgers his first MVP either; brutal efficiency did the trick.
Rodgers did lead the league in adjusted (9.5) and net (7.68) yards per attempt, and he had the lowest interception rate (1.0 percent). He didn't break the season record for passer rating like the last time around, but he came in second to Tony Romo at 112.2.
Better yet, Rodgers lifted everyone around him and led the Packers to a 12-4 record and the brink of a Super Bowl appearance on one leg, hobbled by a debilitating calf injury late in the year. 
Green Bay is going to win the super bowl this year because the should have last year. They got beat because of the onside kick. If the guy in front of Jordey didn't go up for the ball, they would have recovered it, and the packers go to the Super Bowl. They didn't lose any starters on their all-star offense except for a tight end (name escapes me). They beat the Patriots in the regular season, and I am 100% positive that they would have beat them again. 

This is why Aaron Rodgers is the best QB of all time (he hasn't even peaked yet), and why Green Bay will win Super Bowl 50. 

IMO He's is the second best looking QB (first being Andy Dalton). I'm a straight male, but if he came to me and wanted to bang, I would bang him so hard. "

"Nope. Love my wife, love my kids.  Its just a new completely different life."
"Oh yeah, I remember that match like it was yesterday. It was *heavily* hyped up here in Brazil, TV pundits were labeling it the 'match of the century' and everything (lol - though for Santos it probably was), the face-off between Neymar and Messi. I also remember one of their players (not sure if it was Léo or Durval) saying, right after their winning the Libertadores, something along the lines of ""let's see if Barcelona is really all that"". And then came the thrashing and everyone was picking on Santos fans for a while hahaha.

Though I must say, I believe Santos lost due to, besides the obvious difference in quality, their players being too 'scared' from the very start. I don't know, they all seemed *too* respectful. I know you always have to be respectful, especially when playing a team of Barcelona's caliber, but I'm talking about something completely exaggerated. Santos was completely unrecognizable from beginning to end. And of course, complete and utterly outplayed and dominated by Barcelona."

I'd suggest keep on doing what you're doing. You'll get there eventually."

This tl;dr attitude of yours discredits your own views. Why would Vice try to promote Ann Coulter? That makes no sense.

"The problem with programming and being poor at math is they are the same thinking pattern - solving how to get from point A to point Z and being able to correctly address all the intermediate steps.

That being said, there's a lot of programming that requires a solid grasp of multivariable calculus level concepts (e.g. game programming) and a lot of programming that you needn't understand much of anything beyond intermediate algebra.  The large portion of programming you do will fall into the latter category unless you are writing graphics engines, collision/physics engines, shaders, 3d/graphic design software, and that sort of thing.

&gt;  Is remembering a lot of equations part of the course? Or is simply applying them in meaningful ways the most important aspect.

You'll probably have to learn more than a few algorithms, which is really not much different from memorizing math equations if you think about math equations properly."

"Luckily, I was able to just google the match-ups without having to watch VODs.

Only one person played Sheik in top 4. Does that make her low tier? Also, 3/8 is a pretty big fucking percentage for one character, bro.

Looking at the bracket, except for Axe and Hugs playing Samus/Pikachu, almost everyone else plays the classic top four: Sheik, Marth, Fox, and Falco. The only exceptions are the guys who are masters of other, lower-tier (relatively) characters (referring to HBox as Puff and Armada as Peach).

Admittedly, going back and looking at it, there were fewer Fox dittos than I thought, although this is partially due to HBox, who never plays anyone but Puff (even Armada doesn't play Peach all the time), who got all the way into Grand Finals and pretty much ruined any chances of a Fox ditto. Doesn't mean it doesn't happen a lot.

So, there, I threw out all hyperbole and actually bothered to back up my statements, and wouldn't you know it, I'm only slightly wrong. I *still* don't understand what I was saying, other than the Fox dittos, you were trying to refute. Fox/Falco/Marth/Sheik are still god-tier with some very special exceptions, and thinking you're going to beat them with 75% of the roster without some *extreme* skill (I'm looking at you, Amsa), is ignorant."

"Those cores are a resource I don't have currently. Not gonna spend that much on a mod that I'll use on ONE weapon.

Not so much asking if it's essential, moreso not wanting to rank up a legendary mod for one more ammo in a weapon that while really fun, definitely isn't optimal for most things. (Which, it's not that I don't want fun, I stopped using Boltor P for a reason. It's the simple fact that 100 R5s, 200 U5s, and whoever knows how many C3s are resources I can't spend because I don't have them. I'm still relatively new, and I spend my cores as soon as I get them to max other, more important mods as I get them.) Sorry being uninformed on the ranking costs of Legendary mods, but as far as I know it costs a lot more than 1 million credit to max them. "

"Pretty simple answer to that: There were options and a way wider span of examplary games to find out how to play Fiora before her rework. - She was a simple, binary champion before they reworked her.

"You keep checking for lethal every turn. The basic formula is num berserkers * num minions * num whirlwinds. Then you add the 2 default damage from the berserkers, 4 from weapon and any other minions you have. Its better to trade weak minions in (armorsmith, acolyte) instead of going face with them.That said, sometimes you just know its like 50 damage and don't need to count. It gets tricky when you have patrons involved, but if you have a patron and frothing with 2-3 whirlwinds and inner rage its probably enough."

"No. We are in 2015. As a community we have an awful track record of exclusion of PoC and trans people. I'm not angry about the accuracy of the movie, absolutely not. It's simply not realistic to expect a complete accurate representation of everything that happened. 

What I am saying is white gay men are heavily represented within media (at least comparatively) and this is great. It's fucking fantastic. I've never felt better being a white gay man. On the other hand, seeing the history of this event, this movie had a chance... it had a chance to represent those in the community who still get hatred and discrimination from all sides in 2015. It has failed in that, and that is short sighted. 

Some major players in Stonewall were PoC and trans. Erasure of that is what I am angry about. It's what everyone should be angry about."

"&gt; No, people quite simply just dislikes losing. From an evolutionary point of view, is that really surprising? If everyone always were content then we would have died out ages ago.  

Lol bro we survived because we didn't give up. Like what I said, we survive as a people because we're the fucking cockroaches of the animal kingdom, no matter what comes our way we cannot be stopped, *because of our undying desire to improve ourselves*. Off topic, but undeniable.  

&gt; People can want to improve and indeed see failures as ways of improvement, but only when you get one or two kills every now and then to make you feel better. So, when you get killed over and over again you kind of lose interest in the game.  

So wrong. Do you play chess? If you don't, you should try it, it's really beautiful. In chess, losing is many times more fulfilling than winning. You learn by losing, not winning. You get to see something different, something beautiful, sometimes something beyond your ability. Maybe a really sharp line did you in and you were blessed with the opportunity to watch it unfold. Something you didn't calculate. Or maybe you were lucky enough to have the privilege of bearing witness to an amazing positional player doing his work. Same for any task - the more you fail at it, the more you learn. If you stick to only what you can succeed at, you are not improving yourself.  

So many times in my years in games (we'll stick to planetside), I've been brutally outskilled by someone else better than me. Sometimes, it's jumping an enemy ESF and then subsequently having them proceed to *utterly wreck the shit out of me*. Other times, it's a 1v1 duel with an elite HA player where he gets mostly headshots and almost no misses, and I die to him without even breaking his shields. I simply stare at my death screen and go, holy fuck that guy is good, *what did I do wrong and what did he do right?* Especially the ESF bit, when I was barely able to handle a simple basic reverse, I wowed in amazement as all the aces did crazy shit with their craft whilst I struggled to even land a single shot. Seriously, had I decided to throw down my shit then and give up instead of staying determined, I would never be able to even glimpse the top end of piloting.  

&gt; This doesn't seem like a problem you ever had as from your post you made it quite clear you were above-average right off the bat.  

Wrong again. I was a shitter and pleb, a fuckwit and a bad. I started off as a monkey with HORRIBLE aim, HORRIBLE situational awareness, and HORRIBLE gamesense. I couldn't do the reverse manoeuvre, I couldn't comprehend for the love of god how to lead with the nosegun, I couldn't kill a HA without losing half my health. I didn't even aim for the heads of stationary targets.  

I died, and I died, and I died. I really, *really* sucked. Most times I died, though, I simply asked myself how I fucked up and how the other guy pulled it off. Slowly, game session by game session... things changed. Well, I improved, so now I am, hopefully, above average.  

&gt; But most ""plebs"" aren't.  

That's the worst attitude to come into a room with. Metaphorical room, that is.

"The thing that gets this most about me, is that he made the decision to purchase a motorbike, and followed through, without discussing it with you from a financial standpoint.

You guys have debt, and children, and were planning for another, and this have affected your vacations, required you to tighten belts etc.

He didn't even make you a part of the 'you think we can afford a bike right now' decision? Do you guys have separate finances? He was saving up a large amount of cash for it and never bothered to tell you? That concerns me more...

But he;s bought it now?  Maybe you'll have to 'get over it', unless you think he'd get rid of it, which i think is unlikely. Or you can compromise that he doesn't go on highways, only on weekends to keep it to a minium, etc, though i don't think that would make much difference.

It really sounds like he totally disregarded you feelings in this, you shouldn't have to issue a 'wifely veto' for him to know that this isn't something you want, and at the very least there should have been more discussion about it if he knew your stance on it, and from a financial standpoint too.

Maybe you should clear the air, have a talk about how you think he should have put your feelings to more consideration here, and involved you more in the decision. Maybe then you can come to terms with the bike. 

Though honestly if this is something thats making your *really* anxious, like sick with worry, i know for me at least, my wifes feelings would probably trump my desire to ride a bike."
"First of all, Neoreaction, in sympathy with most forms of legitimate reactionary thought, is quite anti-ideological. So suffixing it with ""-ism"" is a first order failure. It is not like anything the modern mind is trained to conceive regarding the nature of power in society.

This is actually quite easy.

You know how your dad is like the boss of everything, but he still loves you and your mom and everything? And how, basically he's a good guy and even though he makes mistakes sometimes, you all love him back? And how the rules that you may have as a family are pretty much decided by dad and mom and kids aren't consulted very much? And how even if you do have a rule, how dad or mom can break them when necessary because they are really looking out for the family's interests?

"Except where bikes are prohibited, highways or some high speed single lane roads for example, they are authorized and even required to operate like motorized vehicles (e.g. obeying speed limits, stopping at signs and lights). Most residential streets do not have minimum speed limits. Since riding in the middle of a lane often has the side effect of pissing off a whole lot of drivers, most riders choose to ride off to the side. This can sometimes be quite dangerous. Give it a try some time and see how many close calls you have with cars trying to squeeze around you."

"I know this doesn't quite answer your question, but I still believe album art is important. I'm a Graphic Design student and what got me interested was album art. When I was a kid my Dad had this awesome record collection and I loved seeing all the craft that was put into it. My favorites were the Rolling Stones *Sticky Fingers* and *Led Zeppelin 3*, the Cream albums, Hendrix, *Caravanserai*, King Crimson, and so many others. I'd look at all the art and he'd tell me all about the band, recordings, and members, and we'd listen to the music on the way to school. As an adult, I go to the library and choose interesting looking albums by their covers. I still think that true album art is so important- it's more the a picture, it's craft. It can be touched and unfolded and it's something to be kept, in a way that CD's or digital booklets just don't seem to be as lasting or physically engaging. It's not a ""hipster"" thing, it's accessible art for everyone. Everyone likes music and it's a way to connect art and design with every audience. "

"Re your baking situation, are you using an oven thermometer so you can actually tell the temperature reaching your clay items?  That's one of the few *required* supplies needed for working with polymer clay, no matter which oven is used or how expensive it was, etc.  They all vary, and they vary from this spot to that spot, etc.

You can bake polymer clay as many *times* as you want though; it will just continue to polymerize more and more.  
I don't know *exactly* how much polymerization is required for polymer clay to be well-enough done, but there's usually a bit more polymerization that can take place over time with longer heating.  
  
The most important thing is to bake polymer clay long and well enough to make it *strong* and so it won't crumble later, leach out any unpolymerized oil onto porous surfaces, etc.    
And there's no way to tell about that by just looking at the clay.  The surface will always be the most polymerized area, but impossible to know what's going on underneath the surface.  That's why it's important to go by the temperature and time being used (for the thickness of the item being cured since thicker things will take longer).  The temperature and time of baking are interdependent too which you probably already know.

I'm a little concerned that by baking the head initially until it's firm but still ""movable,"" you're creating a situation that may more easily create cracks later.  Polymer clay can be subject to certain kinds of ""stress"" even when raw that can cause certain things to be more likely to happen later; that's especially true for the push-pull or stroking kind of sculpting. 

Cooling the clay by putting in frig or freezer awhile or by letting it sit overnight or a few hours will definitely make polymer clay firmer since you're removing all recent friction. 
   
You might also want to consider using a firmer polymer clay than you're already using too though since that will improve those kinds of problems.  Which one are you using btw?    
Here's the general order of the firmest polymer clay brands and/or lines to the softest ones (which are also usually weakest after baking, and least able to take fine detail)...you might have a few other brands where you live as well:  
...Kato Polyclay...Fimo Classic (though FC is being reformulated and don't know what it will end up like, but probably softer)  
...Premo...Cernit  
...Sculpey Souffle (though it will have a different texture)...Fimo Soft (personally never liked this one since most colors kind of sticky and unpredictable when shaping)    
...Super Sculpey (some boxes are firmer than others though)...Sculpey III...Craftsmart or Bakeshop  
...original plain Sculpey

For real sculpting (making realistic sculpts), one of the flesh-colored ""doll clays"" can be good but many sculpting clayers also just mix the various flesh-colored clay brands together to get a mix they like...e.g., ProSculpt and PuppenFimo, as well as SuperSculpey.  And gray-colored SuperSculpey-Firm is also firmer.

Re sanding-and-buffing, or just sanding, even the wet-dry sandpaper (used wet) is too stiff to do a *lot* of tiny dimensional areas.  Sometimes clayers will wrap the sandpaper around a toothpick or paint brush end or some other shape to help though.  
But there are also particular bits used in small *electric* rotary tools (like the Dremel brand) that can much more easily do that kind of thing. Because polymer clay is actually pretty soft compared to metal and wood, bits like the solid felt ones will actually ""sand"" polymer clay, for example.  Electric tools like Scumbusters can hold sandpaper too.

Regular wet-dry sandpaper (usually 400 grit, followed by 600 grit at least) is used a lot though by many polymer clayers, but mostly for the sanding-then-buffing technique.  It's used on flat items of course, but also on gently curved surfaces like lentil beads, tube beads, etc, and even on more curved round/oblong/etc beads (though there are some nifty ways clayers have created for doing ""lots of small beads"" at one time--like using small squares of sandpaper or various kinds of grit, etc, in a rock tumbler or even in a container in a dryer, e.g.).

"10% base damage reduction on enemy AI combatants, plus a 10% precision damage nerf on top of that. You're going to notice that, cumulatively - especially if it is additive and not multiplicative. It depends on the enemies we'll be seeing in TTK, their respective bulkiness, and the new perks and Shotgun archetypes, but I can say with certainty that 35 POE Caps/Servitors would be much more of a pain than they already are with the PvE nerf. Especially with the low Cap stagger rates, and their tendency to be able to proc their short-range warp even when directly under fire.

What's worse is that Fusion Rifles, the natural alternative to Shotguns, aren't getting *any* buff in PvE. It's ridiculous, if you ask me. No one uses them already, but they're having projectile travel time lengthened and no combatant damage Ai buff to compensate. Meh."

For goodness sake, her husband was impeached basically due to major character flaws (perjury &amp; obstruction of justice) that she likely helped construct. While those are not necessarily reflective of her leadership ability (which I also question) they are certainly a reflection of character and indicate that she is not the type of person I'd want running things.

How's the fit on this navy Napoli I picked up from Suit Supply last weekend (for my sister's wedding in September)? 

Mostly interested in the jacket because even though I'm 6' tall I ended up with a 42S after the employee helping me said the 42R looked too long.  

Please ignore the crappy shoes as well as the dress shirt that's slightly too big. I'm getting new ones this/next weekend. Also, the pants look too long in these pictures because I didn't pull them up enough/have a belt handy, they were fine in the store.

Thanks!"

"I think Autor has made the point elsehwere that there are going to be winners and losers with this change in technology, and at the moment it looks like maybe there are more losers than winners.  You've got your relatively well off cognitive elite at the top (your highly paid google engineers or whatever), and then there's a huge army of people working for uber or taskrabbit or whatever to basically service their every whim and do all their chores for them, because the opportunity cost for coders to not be churning out code is too high.  And you basically end up with a world that looks like downton abbey.  I think maybe that's where we seem to be heading, more than a robot apocalypse, though if all you're qualified to do is work a checkout then good luck."

"I was not in one, but I was in your situation so I'll give my advice and story.

It was my best friend and roommate at the time.  This girl cheated on him and treated him like crap and then blamed him for her doing it.  First, I confronted him about it and how she is not good and a horrible girlfriend.  Many other friends did this also.  As mentioned in other posts, this seem to drive him towards her so he could ""prove us wrong"".  

Every time he would complain, I'd just ask why doesn't he break up with her, she's treating him like crap, etc.  It seemed to just make it worse.

What actually worked was me having one final talk with him.  I explained my thoughts and feelings about her and the relationship.  I didn't like how she treated him and he seemed miserable.  This is the important part.  When I was done I explained that from now on I would not give him any advice on the situation.  If he wanted to talk about it, that was fine but all I would do was just listen.  That's it.  I wouldn't comment on it besides ""that sucks"" or ""I hope it goes well"".  I would still talk to him about other things, but this was my limit for this topic.

At first I don't think he understood.  He would start talking about her and expect me to respond.  I always responded with something to the effect of what I said above and that was it.  He would make a few comments about it like ""that's all you're going to say"".  I just responded with ""You know how I feel about this.  I'm not going to keep saying it.  It's your choice and it just waste time to keep going through the same conversation.""

When I first said that, it seem to really hit him hard.  It was a look of ""Wow, he really doesn't care about this relationship.  He still cares about me, but he's letting me make my own choice.""  I could tell he continued to think on that for a while.

A few weeks later they broke up and he later confessed that it was the way I acted above that led to him breaking it off.

YMMV."

"&gt; But they won't get reported,

You could report them yourself. As far as I know, it only takes 1 report for that ""instance"" to get looked at and additional reports within the same game (against the same player), don't do anything. Once it's flagged, it's flagged. At least that's my understanding of the system. They might not get banned for just one instance though, so yeah you may see them again. Just keep report each time they break the rules. DON'T report every time you see them though, because if it's not legit, your value goes down. "

"To some extent, but nothing like in the movies.

Images are essentially grids of numbers. A black-and-white image might be stored as one number per pixel where each number is in the range 0 to 255, 0 being black, 255 white and the values in between greys from almost black to almost white.

Suppose we have a very small image where the pixels look like this:

    [   0 ]  [ 128 ]  [   0 ]  
    [ 128 ]  [ 255 ]  [ 128 ]  
    [   0 ]  [ 128 ]  [   0 ]

The image looks like a tiny cross with a bright pixel in the middle and four grey pixels north, south, east and west of it.

We want to blow this image up by inserting an extra row between each pair of rows and an extra column between each pair of columns. But we have a problem. Is this a picture actually of a cross? It might be a square rotated through 45 degrees (a diamond shape). It could also be a circle. So if we want  to blow the image up, there are various ways we could do it to keep it looking like a cross, a square, or a circle. Here's what it might look like as a cross:

    [   0 ]  [   0 ]  [ 128 ]  [   0 ]  [   0 ]  
    [   0 ]  [   0 ]  [ 255 ]  [   0 ]  [   0 ]  
    [ 128 ]  [ 255 ]  [ 255 ]  [ 255 ]  [ 128 ]  
    [   0 ]  [   0 ]  [ 255 ]  [   0 ]  [   0 ]  
    [   0 ]  [   0 ]  [ 128 ]  [   0 ]  [   0 ]  

and here's what it might look like as a diamond:

    [   0 ]  [   0 ]  [ 128 ]  [   0 ]  [   0 ]  
    [   0 ]  [ 128 ]  [ 255 ]  [ 128 ]  [   0 ]  
    [ 128 ]  [ 255 ]  [ 255 ]  [ 255 ]  [ 128 ]  
    [   0 ]  [ 128 ]  [ 255 ]  [ 128 ]  [   0 ]  
    [   0 ]  [   0 ]  [ 128 ]  [   0 ]  [   0 ]  

They look quite different, and if we blew the image up even more, they would look even more different.

So which one is right? The answer is that either one could be correct, and **the original image does not contain enough information for us to be able to tell.**

And this is the problem with the digital enhancement you see in movies: they extract information from the image that *was never there to start with*. It is simply impossible to enhance a fuzzy CCTV image of a crime suspect whose face is 4 pixels square into a crystal-clear image that will allow you to identify them."

 [artist pic](http://img2-ak.lst.fm/i/u/252/0113f4cb7837456a82a20a18a443d8bb.png)  

&gt; Brad Sucks is the stage name of the artist Brad Turcotte, whose ""one man band with no fans"" was among the first to take full advantage of the free culture movement for advertising and distribution. (He is not to be confused with Brad Turcotte, the manager of Compadre Records.)

&gt; Turcotte opened his website in 2002 with the intention of producing ""open source music"". His self-produced single, Brad Sucks One, included the audio source files used to create the finished files, and later he posted these source files to his website along with the MP3s.

&gt; Turcotte waives all rights to his songs, essentially making them public domain. This total freedom allows him to promote his music through sites such as Magnatune and ccMixter, as well as Myspace and Podsafe. Since he was one of the first to make this decision, he also received free publicity through blogs and interviews in free culture magazines. His first full CD, I Don't Know What I'm Doing, was released both through Magnatune and a limited ""professional"" printing from his own website.

&gt; Turcotte also runs the website stripcreator.com , which allows participants to create their own talking-head webcomics. He is also the creator of in4mador. He is also listed on Sellaband, a website where artists co-ordinate raising money to record an album.

"Actually I would. I took the use of toxic as a specific modifier to masculinity. The idea being that true masculinity should be celebrated, but the ideas that are presented as ""masculine"" that are problematic and listed above, are toxic. I see the eating disorders ad unhealthy submissiveness as the same; a toxic form/representation/presented idea of femininity. They are both inaccurate and toxic, but being presented as masculinity and femininity.
 I see so many problems in communication between people who are clearly ideologically compatible but biases in linguistics get way in the way. It's a strange phenomenon that I see consistently. It appears to be keeping a lot of us from coming together on issues, and the root is frequently that one goes into discussions of emotional topics with a defensive attitude, which is also to say one assumes the other to be against you from the get go. Argument vs discussion. I don't dream to say it's the only problem, but I see it as a big one. It's a pervasive but still learned behavior that can be overcome with conscious effort, and I propose we could all benefit from putting in that effort."

"It's another personality system like myers Briggs. There are 9 types, divided into 3 groups, people with shame issues, people with anxiety issues, and people with anger issues. Within each group there is an extravert, an ambievert, and an introvert. So the introverted anxious person is a 5, someone who quells their anxiety by figuring out how things work, the ambiverted anxious person is a 6, someone who quells their anxiety by fulfilling their duties and roles, and the extraverted anxious person a 7, someone who quells their anxiety with a lot of pleasurable activities and thoughts. 

Not every person with the same type is exactly the same however as their are levels of health. The lower the level, the less functioning and more in the grips of the personality the person is. 

Most infp's are 4's, the individualist, who tries to quell feelings of shame by feeling special and unique compared to others, and 9's, the peacemaker, who try to quell their feelings of anger by numbing out and feeling at peace"

"""Crops that don't need much water don't bring in much money. If you're running a farm, there's no way you can pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to drill a deep well and pay for it with drought-friendly crops.""

I get the villainizing of nut trees, but it's not the whole problem. Livestock, particularly cattle, uses way more water than any pistachios or almonds do. Or the alfalfa that they grow to feed the cows.

With just your link, I'm not sure the point your trying to make. Some farmers need more water so they plant more expensive crops that need more water? That's classic supply and demand for you."

"We didn't need 90% of stuff we packed so tight. We had two duffel bags of stuff, but all she really needed was a ribbon for her hair and a toothbrush. Even the toothbrush - the hospital provided one, we haven't used it. Slippers, socks, underwear, towels, bottles of water, two changes of clothes, diapers, wipes, rash cream - we didn't need any of this! She was dressed in the hospital gown all the time and didn't need any of those. They provide socks, pillows enough to pile a mountain, all hygienic supplies, everything!

""Next time"" all we would take is:
1. One change of clothes for her, for going home
2. One change of clothes for the baby, for going home
3. Hair ribbons/pins/glasses, whatever you can't function normally without
4. Cell phone and charger (two chargers for both of you)
5. A second bag to take things home (they'll give you a lot of stuff!)
6. Camera. Check the batteries. 

That's IT!
Also, we live 5 minutes from the hospital and I have been at home, like, 4 times while my wife was in post partum. I could bring anything she would need, but she needed nothing!

"My girlfriend has been an elementary teacher for 3 years now. She likely isn't going to last another. It's a field that takes basically no effort to get into and it's highly saturated. Teachers get burned out of the industry within a few years and there's a huge pool for the employers to choose from of eager first-year teachers who will work for pennies only to repeat the cycle. The field as a whole is broken. Nobody respects teachers and they deal with way more stress than they deserve due to awful pay, bloated administration, horrible parents, and constant budget cuts. "

All you need is a ton of beer and duct tape. Whenever you finish a beer you take it and tape it to the top of the last beer you drank.

Here's the catch: there can be only one. When another person reaches White Wizard status the two wizards must duel it out using their staffs. Whoevers staff breaks first loses and the winner becomes the new White Wizard."
"For everyone talking about his ""Great presidency"", I feel the comments here betray the youth of the Reddit audience. 

For instance, bring up how hated Bill Gates used to be. ""What???? He is such a humanitarian! He is a great guy, he's not hated!"" Through the 90's, Gates was seen as a cartoon like megalomaniac. He changed course much later in life to how he is today. 

Carter is the same way. He devoted his life to charity after serving, but he was not a popular president. 

Plus, he's 90. It's not exactly tragic news a 90 year old man is ill. He's a good man for all his efforts, but if anything the media is treating it like an unthinkable tragedy."

"What I've done in the past is make a spreadsheet that listed out all the possible combinations of successful hands based on how many distinct categories there are. In your case, there would be Chalices, Moxen, Lands, and Other. You would identify all the possible arrangements that qualify as successes (4 Chalices, 1 Mox, 2 Land, 0 Other; 3 Chalices, 2 Moxen, 2 Land, 0 Other; etc.), calculate each occurrence separately, then add. 

Since this is multivariate, in order to calculate each individual probability, you'd calculate it as ((4 choose X) * (4 choose Y) * (26 choose Z) * (26 choose A)) / (60 choose 7). As an example, the odds of having exactly 1 Chalice, 1 Mox, 2 Land, and 3 Other is ((4 choose 1) * (4 choose 1) * (26 choose 2) * (26 choose 3)) / (60 choose 7), or 3.50%.

This may not be 100% accurate as I drew it up pretty quickly, but by my math, the chances of having at least 1 Chalice, at least 1 Mox, at least 2 Land, and 3 of whatever else (whether they're extra Chalices, extra Moxen, extra Land, or just Other) given 4 Chalices, 4 Moxen, 26 Land, and 26 Other is 11.42%.

EDIT: one advantage of setting up a spreadsheet is that you can easily toy with the numbers to see how things would change. For example, if you swapped out a land for another spell, bringing you to 25 land and 27 other, the odds of a successful opening 7 would drop to 11.04%, whereas adding an extra land and taking out a spell (27 Land, 25 Other) takes you to 11.78%."

"&gt; Most of them will have plenty enough money for studies and get a real job after. You can studie whenever you want. Why would it be any difference to do it when you are 20 or when you are 40?

I think you'll find, once you get older, that if you have done a lot of different, ""non-serious"" stuff in your twenties, it's much harder to find a serious job. Sure you can work as a waiter or whatever, but if you want to be something like a lawyer, banker, etc, it's going to be very hard to get hired even for entry level positions if you're 30 and no previous ""real"" work experience.

I would also say that the people who have what it takes to be the best at eSports, are also going to be the ones who have very high chances at a successful career (assuming their personality is not dogshit) - in the long run, you might financially be better off working 20 years as a lawyer than winning an international and then fading off into obscurity."

"I hope not. The SEC going to a 9 game schedule would mean that beefing up strength of schedule is necessary for playoff contention. I think adding a 9th conference game but dropping a good OOC game would offset each other and not improve strength of schedule. 

Starting in 2016, the SEC is requiring all teams to play at least one OOC P5 team every year. If that rule remains in place and the SEC goes to 9 games, that should preserve UGA-GT, SCar-Clemson, Florida-FSU, &amp; Kentucky-Louisville."

&gt; The Hamilton family move into a large country house on the Yorkshire Moors to supervise its restoration from a dilapidated B&amp;B to the original Victorian grandeur. When Meg Hamilton, wife, mother and renovation expert first loses her London team after an accident, then a local Yorkshire team too superstitious to continue, she's forced to carry on alone. The discovery of a secret attic room, a Rosicrucian mosaic, a bricked up root cellar and many other unexplainable events gradually convince Meg, her husband Alec and children Penny and Harper, that they're not only restoring the house, but also its original Victorian owners who died 150 years ago. But before they can escape, the house - and its former occupants - force them to spend one last, terrifying night under its roof.

The interface is nice - you can easily input every type of record you need - no need to hope that SRV is an option in cPanel or in your registrar's console.  Every input field is clearly labeled.  Propogation is fast.  I definitely prefer it.  Also, its really easy to switch between domain names if you need to manage multiple.

It's free - give it a try.  They scan your dns records before you migrate to them, so its easy to keep everything the same / not break email or other services."

"Orthogonal objects have no projection onto one another. That's why right angles are orthogonal: if you project a vector onto another vector which is at a right angle to it (take a dot product), it's zero.

A projection can mean different things when we're talking about different objects. The projection of a signal f onto another signal g is generally taken to be

∫ fg dx

This is analagous to vector projection because when you take the dot product of a vector and itself, you get the squared magnitude. Likewise, projecting f onto f is

∫ f^2 dx

Which is the square of the total signal power. Note that signals with finite power live in Hilbert space.

Orthogonal signals are f and g such that

∫ fg dx = 0

which many functions satisfy. A simple example is to use sinusoids: sin(x) and cos(x) are orthogonal, as are sin(ax)/sin(bx) and cos(ax)/cos(bx) for all a!=b, a and b are integers.

So for example you could generate orthogonal signals by sending two signals which are 90 degrees out of phase with each other. 180 degrees out of phase would be a polarity switch, the orthogonal signal is (or, rather, can be) halfway between."
"Well, I think that it's a combination of the two. The fact that USB microphones aren't going to translate digitally as well as a good pre-amp/interface and an XLR is a good reason why they're not prevalent.

"Hey, honestly, I totally agree with you on that; Loomis IS the problem in my book. The contracts DO hurt, I just don't agree that this is the outstanding issue. I never liked the way he pushed cap money down the line with restructures because that's just letting the poison linger, but at the same time, he kinda *had* to do it because of the poor drafts, which is also a GM issue. There's some moves I just can't blame him over, because I think any GM would have done the same, such as going all in on Byrd(no one would have expected THIS bad of a FA bust from him) and extending Galette. At the time, they were good ideas. But then Byrd plays poorly, gets hurt, and Galette loses his damn mind. I have to think that some of these moves are because he knows he cant keep missing and still keep his job, but it seems like things just keep blowing up in his face. But yes, my main point is just that we have two big problems (finances and drafting) that happen to make each other look even worse, and stem from one source(Loomis).  
  
One last thing though, I don't think we have a locker room problem. Galette just.. lost it. The money really changed him. Our beat writer, Kat Terrell, [wrote a great piece on his story.](http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2015/07/junior_galette_5.html) It's actually pretty sad. Other than him, our team is usually pretty charismatic and have great synergy. The only other exception might be Jimmy Graham, who started to care more about the life than the game. Hopefully for him, that changes in Seattle."

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/Snapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/snapchat/comments/1saxrg/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/Snapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Snapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSnapChat).

"From what I can tell, the Shadowrun games by HBS don't follow the Shadowrun tabletop game rules that closely. They're basically taking a (fantastically awesome) setting from the tabletop, and made a system loosely based on the real one to show that setting.

Pathfinder's strength REALLY isn't its setting. It's the rules with oodles of content already made for it, and its popularity making is less painful than most tabletops to get a group for it. I don't think it'd convert as nicely as Shadowrun did if they try and pull the exact same thing."

"&gt; Does a religion need to have a minimum group membership or age to be called a religion? Does it need to have a specific framework? Does it need to have stemmed from a regional identity?

That's of philosophical interest but not of practical interest here. What matters is that religion on its own is: heavily ""inherited"" from parents/culture (though not ""immutable""), not harming others, and a historic basis for serious discrimination. 

If a religion, no matter how small, is being marginalized to maintain a dominant/established religion, that is discrimination.

If a religion starts harming others, that aspect is openly criticized. People's actions and attitudes (including the act of associating with hate groups) can be criticized even if they have a religious basis. 

The GamerGate parallel: there is no history of discrimination against gators. Gators are being judged by their actions and attitudes and how those harm others. This is the exact basis and context where we consider judgement valid for anyone. "

"- Shanahan's issue was mainly that he did not take RG3 out of the postseason game. People wanted him out due to how they felt about Kyle Shanahan as their offensive coordinator, and everyone was pointing to Shanahan's record here (which was not impressive pre-2012). I wanted to keep Shanahan for his final season, but we know how all of that turned out.
- Did any of our quarterbacks play well last season? Colt looked good on paper, but on the field he was not impressive (screen passes and check downs). Kirk had issues with throwing some extremely ugly interceptions (putting the ball in places where receivers were not even near). Griffin had issues releasing the ball in reasonable time.
- We had just drafted Brandon Scherff. He has only played two preseason games, and was completely blown up on a play. Morgan Moses is starting on the line, and his play was pretty poor last year. It will take time and experience for our line to play average.
- Jay Gruden is not a good coach. It was a terrible hire, and I would be saying that no matter who was the quarterback - The hire did not make sense, and while our roster arguably improved last season, our team looked much worse than it did in 2013. There may be a transition moving from Shanahan's system to Gruden's system, but you do not expect to see a team with a decent amount of talent (WRs, RBs, TEs, LT) struggle so much on offense (even under Kirk/Colt).

I could say that both Kirk and RG3 could have a slim chance of being a capable starter, but not under the terrible coaching we have seen last season. I want to stick with these quarterbacks because it's not like the past few QB draft classes have been too impressive. It's not about being in X or Y camp - I am saying that there are much bigger issues at hands with our team, between our last few draft classes and our coaching."

"Since you've only been playing a few months, I wouldn't call it a losing streak. It's just losing. A streak means you go through a period where you lose more than your normal rate. It sounds like you've learned a lot and have more to learn. That's true for all of us.

Everyone suffers from mana screw and top decks. What sets apart the best players is that they continually ask themselves what they could have done to win in spite of the bad luck. Train yourself to let go of the frustration as quickly as possible and learn from it.

For mana screw, was your mana base as good as it could have been? Was your deck too ambitious, demanding a shaky mana base? Should you have mulliganed?

For top decks, could you have killed your opponent more quickly? Did you have a different play that would have protected you from that top deck and not opened up any other outs? When you're in the lead and closing a game, it is rare that you will be 100% to win. The best you can do is minimize their outs. If you're sure you did that, say ""Good game"" and move on. If you're not sure, say ""Good game"" and tighten your play.

"Hey there! Welcome back to the game.

I'm no leaderboarder, and I play exclusively Hardcore, so I don't have much to offer you in the way of specific strategy. That said, I can give you some general advice, based on my own experience.

In a nutshell, your two primary goals are to **reach Level 13** and **complete all the Council quests**, and you want to do those as efficiently as possible. To help in this aim:

1. **Learn the quests.** Almost every quest can be accelerated in some way; for instance, you'll find sonars-in-biscuits in the Bat Hole faster if you're boosting item drops. Get familiar with what each quest entails--and a great way to do this is just by playing the game!

2. **Identify your resources.** Once you know what each quest requires, the next step is to identify what resources you have that can help you out. What sources of +item do you have? Are there things that drop during a run that you can use? Don't worry about being *the most optimal* here, just start thinking about what you can use, and play around. Again, a great way to do this is just by playing the game!

3. **Set intelligent goals and be mindful of costs.** I used to spend dozens of turns during my runs farming ingredients for reagent pastas--I'd go to Cobb's Knob Kitchens and spend 30, 50 turns farming knob sausages so I could cook awesome-quality pasta. Do you see my error?

 I wanted to make good food to generate more turns to adventure with, but for each pasta that gave me 25 adventures, I probably wasted 10 adventures in the Kitchens, doing *nothing* to advance my run. I focused exclusively on my narrow goal of making good food, and lost sight of the big goals--complete quests, reach Level 13.

 Your day-to-day goals should always bring you closer to your primary goals. Keep them in mind to avoid being penny wise, pound foolish.

4. **Have fun!** Seriously. There's no point in driving yourself mad with turn-saving calculations if it doesn't make you happy.

Finally, if you haven't done it yet, I strongly advise you start completing the Bounty Hunter Hunter's daily bounty hunts and saving up filthy lucre so you can eventually purchase the Manual of Transcendent Olfaction. Olfaction is one of the most powerful single skills in the game, and will *undeniably* speed up your ascensions. It takes a lot of work to get it, but it's worth it!

If you have any more questions, please feel free to ask me!"

"Well, it's always had its challengers; but it took a well-established scholar of Mark Goodacre's patience and politeness for them to be taken very seriously by mainstream academics. His (and others') basic point is that without the unfounded assumption that Matthew and Luke were composed independantly, there's no need to posit a common source document (which is after all entirely unattested in ancient literature and the archaeological record). 

[Matthias Klinghardt](http://vridar.org/2012/09/09/the-marcionite-gospel-and-the-synoptic-problem-a-new-suggestion/) and [Alan Garrow](http://www.alangarrow.com/synoptic-problem.html) have since produced notable  theories on the synoptic problem which also obviate the need for a Q document. I think a combination of these (substituting Marcion's gospel for canonical Luke in Garrow's theory, a possibility he is open to) is the closest we've gotten to resolving the issue."

"This whole witch hunt has pissed me off just like the whole Hogan scandal but I can't blame WWE for doing what they had to do. I do blame the people who went digging for dirt to start this shit though. They knew what they were doing and they knew this would happen. It was petty malice, nothing more.


Racism and bigotry isn't about what you say, it's about how you treat other people. A joke about a Disney princess or being partially wrong about potentially offensive iconography doesn't make her the evil cunt that social media and wrestling fans have made her out to be. At this point these people are just as bad, if not worse than the SJWs that they complain about in any other situation(their precious video games, for instance). It's blatant hypocrisy.


Her fault was being reckless. It doesn't matter what your views are, the mechanics of modern society have everyone by the balls so if you don't conform to political correctness, the consequences are gonna hurt, justified or not. Especially if you work for a company like WWE. Fairness and freedom of speech won't pay her bills. She should have been more careful but maybe she'll chalk it up to a lesson learned the hard way.


It's not the same circumstance but I would argue that someone can have all the so called ""bad"" thoughts they want but it doesn't warrant this kind of response. It's a slippery slope, this whole ""trial by public opinion"" thing that's become so common these days and going all thought police on all people makes you worse than them. If they're not harming anybody or forcing anybody to think like they do, why does it matter? Shit like this deliberately hurts their life."

For a personal response essay, though, I would say it's fine (perhaps even imperative) to use ""I"", because the whole point of a personal response is to be, well, personal.

Ideally you should clarify with your teacher what she intends you to do. If you want to err on the side of caution, you could potentially write the whole thing without saying ""I"", though some of your sentences might sound a bit stilted."

"Well, okay, you're right about a lot of stuff.  I wasn't trying to say you're wrong, and maybe I shouldn't have been so definitive by saying they're impossible to balance.

In fact if you look at winrates and stuff, most of these bruisers and juggernauts are pretty balanced right now.

But they're balanced because they're boring.  For most melee juggernauts like Darius and Garen, you simply either win lane or you don't.  You can either dive the backline and deal damage or you can't.  There's no skillshot or set up to it.  It depends on team comps and how your lane went.  

Sure you can build a comp around Darius but it simply wouldn't be as strong as a comp built around disengage/poke or hard engage/damage.  And you lose disengage, peel, lockdown, and hard engage by picking someone like Darius.  It's simply why you don't see it in pro play.

Part of the problems with Juggernauts too is that these tanky initiators like Maokai and Gnar can match them in damage.  If Darius lacks the CC that Maokai and Gnar does, then he should be doing more damage, but he doesn't really.

I say there's no solution because because I think the problem has been incorrectly identified.  I don't think there was much of a problem in the first place.  I think it's ok to have boring bruisers with a binary playstyle.  People don't have to play them.  Don't take these bruisers and try to make their kits all wacky and fun, because it's just too hard to balance.  This morde kit will never be balanced.  Darius with heals and even more reset damage will probably never be balanced.

"If you're talking about the linked study, to be fair, it's only measuring perceived racism, not actual racist viewpoints. When a good portion of the Internet is a giant echo chamber for these people to work themselves up into a tizzy over any progression on the part of people of color, and when they're told ""It's not as cool anymore to say that stuff because this isn't 1950s America,"" I think they freak out and report that they feel attacked.

I'm with you. I haven't actually experienced racism from black people, and if anything, I've got more family members than I'd like to admit that are openly racist. One of whom I worry about because she's a super-conservative Christian with possible mental problems and thinks Obama's legitimately a Kenyan Muslim and that it's something to fear. I don't think I've ever had long racial diatribes written about me for the world to see, I have never been literally attacked for being white, I haven't even been called a fucking cracker, but people of color in the US have pretty much all experienced at least one instance of it unless they're as pale as I am. I don't have people coming up and asking me ""So where are you from?"" and giving me an odd look when I answer my home state, only to be asked, ""Yeah, but what I mean is like...where are you *really* from?"" insinuating that despite my middle-American accent I'm not actually from the US or that I was expected to respond ""Oh, Ireland, Germany, Wales, and Scotland."""

"Do you want strong arguments or do you want ones with the best chance of getting you what you want? Oddly enough, in my experience with literature snobs, these two things have very little overlap.

The strong arguments would center around what makes a book literature. What it imparts to culture, what it draws from the same, the splendor of the prose, the depths it draws the mind to.

The successful arguments would center around asking for some specific easy-to-use resource or list that you are allowed to draw from, and finding LotR on that list, as LotR is on a significant number of such lists, save the most restrictive (and if she wants to grade reports for the same two dozen books over and over, you can let her be an insufferable bore).

"The main reason is to avoid the ""door zone"". If someone opens their door without checking if it's clear you're likely to get hit or will have to swerve left possibly right in front of a car. If you get hit you will get thrown left-ish onto the lane right into traffic. It's obviously a very dangerous situation. A car door swings out a bit more than 1 meter so you should keep a distance of at least 1.5 m from parked cars to be safe.

Another reason to take the lane is to signal to cars behind you that ""hey, there's not enough room to drive past me - you have to overtake me properly using the left lane""."

If you take many parts of Asia/eastern society and look at their culture you notice a lot of similarities. 

Samurai and Kamikaze. Honouring the family name, keeping the tradition. 

Suicide is a sad thing. And the loss of a life is unfortunate. However it's also something that if looked in another way its success. Dying to a blade, overdosing on medication, jumping off a building. It takes courage to accept the final demise. But it ends a different kind of suffering. And that is why suicide shouldn't be shunned. It's not just a matter of being alive and actually living. It's something that some just can't deal with. 

Not advocating for everyone to just off themselves. But to look at things in a different light. "

Who's to say that those who are religious have it correct in thinking that being religious protects them? Maybe it makes them more vulnerable. Additionally, each type of spiritual experience may follow different rules or different ones might be covered under the different points I've made. Maybe demonic possession doesn't really exist, but experiencing the holy spirit does AND requires faith to happen.

"So I try getting through the passage as quick as I can, and I don't personally notate at all. Obviously RC is the one section that brings your personal preference into the equation the most, however you clearly need to make some changes to speed up. I think one of the biggest hurdles for me, was being ok with not understanding every detail in the passage, and having comfort knowing that my speed through the passage allows me to go back on detailed oriented questions and still complete passages in enough time. Are you having difficulty with understanding the argument structure of passages? I have found that knowing the argument structure and main aspects of the passage allows you to understand the more broad questions quite easily.

I would recommend cutting down on notation if possible. Notating while you learn RC is an ok strategy, but if you can keep track of author opinions or main points in your head, I think it could go a long way when it comes to speed. You could practice reading dense material by looking at sources such as the economist or the other recommended materials that commonly get suggested. Make sure you are not getting stuck on certain questions for a long time. I know it's hard, but you can't take a ton of time on a question due to the time limit."

* [JumpPark in Prague](http://praha.jumppark.cz/) - I think they opened recently.

* [Paintball in Milovice](http://www.paintball-milovice.cz/) - Former military training area and Soviet military base.

* [Techmania Science Center in Plzeň](http://techmania.cz/) - I was there a month ago. A whole day fun.

* [U6 in Ostrava](http://svet-techniky-ostrava.cz/en) - Similar science center to the previous one but a bit smaller and oriented more on engeneering stuff (old locomotives, cars,...). I was there two years ago and also lot of fun.

* [Rope-climbing Park Tarzania](http://www.tarzanie.cz/en/) - The largest rope-climbing park in Czechia. [Here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/49%C2%B031'13.5%22N+18%C2%B014'16.3%22E/@49.5204162,18.2378611,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0).

I don't see it as much about choosing the strongest spell and healing every few turns so much as trying to get off your strongest spell in between turns of healing without wiping. FF7 isn't very hard in that regard but there is always room for improvement.

"I'm currently in the middle of a massive, sprawling Next Gen project called [Pieces: A Story Cycle](http://archiveofourown.org/works/674219/chapters/1233745). Each Next Gen child we've been told of is getting a chapter, a short (ish) moment from their life that defines them as they exist in my headcanon. I've written twelve so far, over the last couple of years. I have five left to go, but I'm into the characters I haven't really figured out yet, so it's been slow going.

Eventually, the plan is to finish the central piece and then write expansion stories for each Next Gen grouping (Teddy, Victoire, and Dominique; James, Molly, and Fred; Rose, Al, and Scorpius (already written); Lily, Hugo, and Lucy; Roxie; and Lorcan, Lysander, Louis, and Maddie Longbottom (an OC)).

If I understand it, memory is allocated for a program's stack which includes space for ""recursive information"" is stored. If you change 7000 to 10000, there are too many recursive ""instances"" of sort() for that allocated amount of memory to hold.

You could work around this by increasing how much memory the JVM allocates, but this doesn't fix the root of the problem. You shouldn't make this many levels of recursion (Usually). You should try to re-think the program. Maybe look into ArrayList"

In the Senate, at the very least, there were serious attempts. For example:

&gt; The Senate Finance Committee’s work was distinguished by two conversations
that took place as it tried to complete the bill, as well as by its long delay in
finally reporting one. The first conversation was between a group of three
Democratic senators—Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus, Jeff Bingaman,
and Kent Conrad—and three Republican senators—Mike Enzi, Chuck Grassley,
and Olympia Snowe. This “group of six” met throughout the late spring, summer,
and early fall of 2009 but could not reach an agreement.122 Despite the group’s
failure, some of the ideas it generated were incorporated into the Finance
Committee bill.12

Source: http://www.aallnet.org/mm/Publications/llj/LLJ-Archives/Vol-105/no-2/2013-7.pdf

And that also begs the question **why** did more Republicans not enter into the discussion. Especially in the Senate their votes would have been most welcome. They really could have changed things! I remember Olympia Snowe aaalmost was persuaded, but just couldn't get there.

The reason why I have such a clear memory of this is because people on the left were so incensed that Obama was still trying to reach out to Republicans. In the beginning Obama really, truly believed that politicians of both parties could be motivated to rise up and engage in what is best for the country.

Furthermore, I had to be well rested, which was difficult considering the test is not cheap, I was nervous and should you fail it, you'd need to wait 6 months before retaking it. Six months I couldn't spare. It was Halloween night and there was a huge party at my friend's place, where I was staying. I drank my Four Loco at another party, got incredibly wasted and had to be carried back home where the crazy party was on. Thanks to Four Loco I was able to go to bed super early (like 8 pm), sleep sound throughout the entire party, while the walls were bouncing and people talking, and all, and wake up refreshed at 6 am. I was not hungover in the slightest, and scored 103/120 on my test (which is not bad). THANK YOU FOUR LOCO!!!"

"The IBM Quietwriter makes NO noise. But, you will need a few extra parts if you can find one. This typewriter works by passing a current through the Platen to the typehead. It MELTS the ink onto the paper. It also has memory and correction. They only made them for a few years during the early 80's. You'll need an extra printhead (just in case) a font module and some fedron to clean the platen.  The platen must be kept clean because even though there is no impact upon it, dirt, dust and ink can interrupt the current through the platen. They were unusually reliable. The only place I've ever seen them for sale is on Ebay, along with ribbons. This is the only non impact typewriter I've ever seen. I owned one for several years. I only sold it because I needed the money."

One thing that gets me though is that if the alternator was bad how come the battery indicator fell to the needle instead of just staying at 12 volts, i.e. not charging..."

""Cisgender"" came about because of the rise of transgender discussions and the need for a word to describe 'normal' gendered people, and normal is considered offensive. People use those words when talking about those specific subjects. Pronouns are a part of every single conversation. Again, it's possible that a new one could catch on, but it seems far easier (and more likely to succeed) to just adopt the colloquial use of the singular 'they' into formal use as well. "

"Short answer is yes.

Long answer is that like BB says pretty much every game, every player has something to do on every play no matter where the ball is hit. For example: if you are a first baseman when there is a runner on second and a ball is hit into right field, you get in between the pitcher's mound and first to act as the cutoff for the outfield throw. If you are on third, you need to stay near third base in case the runner is caught in a rundown between third and home. That is a pretty basic explanation because I'm really tired and need to go to bed soon and there are thousands and thousands of other scenarios that could come up, but to answer your question, yes there are a lot of differences. 
The positions are pretty similar in terms of skill with a third baseman needing more range and a better throwing arm, but the strategy of playing a new position is usually entirely new if you haven't played there before. "

"Historically religions more often function as a basis for morality and the foundation upon which civilization was built.  It was not until civilization had reached the point that the structures and basic rules were so deeply I grained that it became possible for people to reject the underwriting belief system without undermining the whole system. 

Yes,  people have abused humans tendency toward religious belief for their own personal gain,  but that tendency for abuse is a fundamental property of humans that is not specific to religion.

Também desconheço qualquer debate sobre a natureza do inferno que tenha base bíblica. O inferno é muito bem descrito na parábola do Lázaro e o Rico. Leia a parábola. Tanto os justos quanto aqueles que foram condenados estão cientes de sua situação, há uma barreira intransponível entre os dois, sendo que os injustos sofrem nas chamas do inferno. Está escrito no evangelho e quem conta a parábola é Jesus!"

And hey, PST is what I fell in love with and first got addicted to, so it's nice that I can maintain on my favorite opiate, but if I could get methadone or something for cheaper I'd probably use that."

You might discuss them in a theology or even a social studies class, but in a science class you discuss what has been *scientifically established*.

Saying we should discuss god in a science class because we haven't scientifically established where the universe and life came from is like saying we should discuss the starship Enterprise in a science class because we haven't scientifically established how to travel faster than light speed."

"It's not just about being subtle it's about showing things from a different perspective. Take the OT episode ""Let That Be Your Last Battlefield"". They meet an alien that is white on one side and black on the other side. Then they meet another alien that's also white on one side and black on the other side. So the audience is think these guys are the same race. Then once they're in the same room together they vehemently hate each other. Why? One guy is white on the right side and black on the other side and the other is black on the right side and white on the other. To the viewer their hatred towards each other is stupid because we were thinking of them as being the same race. What difference does it make which side is white and which side is black?

And then you realize, what difference does it make if someone is all white or if someone is all black. And then it hits you... racism is really dumb. 

It being sci-fi and keeping it a little subtle isn't just hiding the point from the censors. It can be hiding the point of the episode from the viewer until it's time to make the reveal. Then you're all like ""hell yeah racism is illogical""."
"I lived with people I knew and got along well with, so I never had any issue.

A false negative in this case is inconsequential, and will be discovered down the line.

As for a false positive, well, one quick bloodtest producing a positive result WILL result in a much more comprehensive test; this will only take a couple of days, so not much time will be lost and, really, they won't start you on any drugs in the meantime.

TL;DR: a false positive will be researched and dealt with within a week, a false negative will be diagnosed down the line and will have no impact if not disclosed (and if done on the side, needn't be, just like they don't go into other normal results for a bloodtest and just focus on the irregularities). So a tacked on HIV test has no downside, and only positives.

"In all honesty I'd suggest not tying yourself down to any ""-ism"" at all. Whilst I consider myself a Trotskyist it doesn't really mean much seeing as three Trotskyists will belong to four different splits.

As for World Revolution Vs. Socialism in One Country? I'd counterpose that Socialism in One Country is the truly counterrevolutionary idea. The idea that one country, or really state, can by itself create a socialist society is laughable. The whole idea was started in the Soviet Union to justify the abandonment of revolutionary activity after the defeats of the early 1920s.

Think about it, if you could build a socialist society in one single country (in reality the Soviet Union) why bother trying anywhere else? World Revolution means supporting revolutions wherever they happen. Yes Trotskyists have problems and critiques of all of them, but who doesn't? That's part of being a revolutionary, thinking about how and why things happened and what can be done next time to make things better.

The theory of Socialism in One Country was a failure and we are living with the results of that failure. It was not, and never meant to be, superior to Capitalism. It was only meant to give breathing room to the Soviet Bureacracy so that it could consolidate its rule over the Soviet Union.

"So often when people talk about first getting fit and being in shape, they are talking about the phyiscal results, but fitness is so much more than that and if you go down this path the right way, you'll see your life change in many, many ways and it will be better  
Everyone has their own excuses, we're all busy people, and it's easier to not put want to put in the work, but thats why you're here in the first place because you want to change yourself and with that comes doing things you dont necessarily want to do and changing your lifestyle to fit your goals in life.  
If you want your body and your life to change, you have to change your lifestyle. 
Now, ultimately the end result is being happy with ourselves and our lives, so Im not saying you have to sacrifice the things you love to do in order to be healthy, you just have to find a balance.  
You dont have to count calories or carbs or any of that stuff, I think its a waste of time. But I would reccomend keeping a food journal and writing down every morsel you eat. You'll be surprised st what youre puting in your body. The less processed and packages foods and the more vegetables the better. i always say, if you can't pronounce the ingredients or if your great-grandparents wouldn't recognize it, dont eat it.  

So if you're tracking what you eat and you know youre eating really healthy, you'll see major changes in your body and how you feel.  

Combine that with an exercise program that you keep track of, and you'll do great things.  

I think its really important as a parent for you to consider changing your lifestyle, because there are so many of us out there that didn't know how bad our lives really were until we became disciplined and focused, and I look back at my old life and I'm in such shock because I thought I was happy and now I still love to do some of the old things I used to, and occasionally I do, but it upsets the pattern I have going for me now and, honestly, I don't miss my old lifestyle in comparison to my new one. i was out of shape, angry, anxious, depressed, insecure, scared, and I did everything half-assed. Now, because I lead a healthier lifestyle, Im actually someone I can be proud of and I wouldn't trade that for the world.  

If you think of it that way, wouldnt you want to make the attempt to try something new so you can be a better parent? Your child is going to look up to you, and if she sees you as a strong, open-minded, independent women who challenges herself and doesnt allow excuses to interfere with her success, she's going to follow suit.

I think that's something worth considering."

"Its interesting the bosses you mentioned from BB are the ones I thought were most heavily inspired by DaS bosses (mind you I haven't played DeS, please come to PSN, please!!) 

Cleric beast- Manus in the taurus demon arena.  I would bet you a dollar it was the same artist, very similar moveset and pacing to the fight as well.  Just made him a fair bit less aggressive and removed the magic aspect of his kit.  

Gerhman- Artorias- I think the inclusion of the grave stones is really genius in that it was a clever way to introduce a cramped, tense, arena that was visually spacious and open (feels like capra demon arena, looks like Artorias arena).  You get so many moments of ""fucking grave stone nooo"", its great.  But gerhman feels very similar to artorias to me, his design and moveset and aggression level really just feel like artorias to me.  

Vicar- This one was relatively new feeling.  It felt like a single stronger gargoyle (maybe the arena makes me think gargoyle, but so does her model) mixed with those anor londo sentinels.  I liked it quite a bit though, maybe would have liked her to be more aggressive.  Or have some of manus' moves that prevented you from getting in standard demon fighting position and wailing on it.  

Martyr- JK this was the most original and most difficult fight in BB to me.  I thought how they handled the phases of the fight (which is new to BB and I love!) was fantastic, he went from hard to harder, instead of lame to difficult (shadows and gerhman feel this way to me).  His moveset was very unique, how he used the sword was unique.  He is how Manus feels in DaS to me.  Just a complete asshole who is always a challenge.   "

"The narrow interpretation I'm applying would read it this way:

The episode starts with them on Earth, having been recalled by Starfleet on Stardate 45959.1 and ends with everyone in their proper places on Stardate 46001.3. Interestingly, this is probably the only episode that has a starting and ending Stardate.

Now, as wishy-washy as the Stardate system is, by this time they had roughly settled into 1000 = 1 year. Ignoring the fractional component, this puts the ""elapsed in-universe time"" (as I'm interpreting the question) at about 15 days.

Certainly Data's head experiences a greater degree of elapsed time, but I don't think this is what the question is asking."

It can't physically run games ""better"", it can either run them at comparable quality but sacrificing frame rate, or it can run them at same frame rate but  sacrificing quality.

"First off, it is not a ""picture"", it  is a weapon skin. Which means that after he opens it up he can use it in game, and it changes the 3D Model of the weapon to match the one shown. It is only available as a rare drop.

Now, A lot of people pay for just visual effects in games. Even if the price is sometimes steep. You would think that a skin, which has no effect on stats or gameplay, would not be bought at all by players but it sells very, very well. And thats talking about games in general, not just CS:GO. Players like to be able to customize their own stuff, including weapons and characters. And when the way to do this is through skin, they are ready to put the money down to make their own character ""unique"". And the rarer the skins get, the happier those people looking for ""uniqueness"" are.

A little bit like car owners. Sure, you can buy a 20k car which will work well for all your needs. But, you could buy that 500k car which there are only 10 in the world. And then you will know that it will be a rare encounter to see someone with the same car. Plus, you like the look of it, thats why you paid for it.

It gives off the premium vibe, and makes it ""yours"". If you see it all the time, it's understandable that some players want to change the look of things.

Also remember that a lot of people don't have minimum wage jobs, and not necessarily kids / wife, and house, so they have a lot of money to spend. 300$ might be much to you, but peanuts for somebody else. And for the game they love, 300$ is well worth it (to them)."

"When she told me about the guy I got upset and asked for details. She always tells me where she is going and with whom. At the time I didn't know the guy nor that they had a fling. My guess is that she was still interested in the guy. I don't know if they did or not something. All their conversation is flirty, but never actually states that they did something. 

She has told me part of the truth. When I asked her about him she only mentioned that they texted once in a while and that they saw each other but in a group because apparently they have friends in common. She always assures me that nothing happened, but their texts imply otherwise. She doesn't mention the part where they almost made out at the beach nor that she was flirting with him. 

Assuming that she did. Is it right or wrong to feel like this. Technically we were not a couple yet, but I just can't help feeling betrayed. Specially when I found that she was sending cute texts at the same when she was flirting with the other guy.

After we became a couple it looks to me that she started to pull away from the other guy. I feel like a second choice. Like she is settling or something with me. I don't know how to explain.

Even though this happened almost a year ago and she seems very in love with me I still feel irritated some times. I'm afraid that If I touch the topic again I'm gonna end up telling her that I read her messages and we all know how's that gonna go "

"I don't recommend dusting a lot of cards. the ammount of dust you get is only a fraction of the value of the card, and It's better to keep your options open for those situations where a unused cards suddenly find a purpose (like tavern brawl). You will start to see triplicates of commons pretty quickly anyways. 

The golden Malygos can pretty much be traded in for a regular Legendary of your choise (if you don't care about golden cards, that is). 

For deckbuilding, focus on finding the strong individual cards like eviscerate, harvest golem and druid of the claw, and slotting those into your decks. Don't start building around Malygos or fancy combos before you have enough cards to make a deck that supports them. 

You cannot craft the cards for patron warrior. The core cards of the deck, Grim patron, Emperor Thaurissan and Death's bite are obtained from the two adventures. 

You can mass-disenchant to automatically dust the cards you have more than 2 non-goldens of. Use the dust to craft staple rares like Azure drake or defender of Argus, cards that you can use in multiple decks. Crafting commons or entire decks at once is inefficient.

I'm not going to build you the ""best"" deck that those cards enable, but as an example, if you were to slot some of those things into a basic mage deck, it might look something like [this](http://www.hearthpwn.com/deckbuilder/mage#31:2;44:2;60:2;74:2;95:1;177:2;213:1;246:1;263:2;274:2;276:1;386:2;489:2;522:2;557:1;595:2;624:2;12227:1;)"

"You do know there are actually feminists like me and my husband who don't agree with feminist radicals and are actually quite vocal about it and the harm that they cause? Feminism is about equal opportunity, at least to me and the many people out there who think like me. For some, it's about superiority, and I criticize that idea where ever I find it. 

So, no, I don't agree with your assessment that feminists can't be criticized because they're soooo ""powerful"" (because we're both doing that exact thing right now), and I don't agree that upholding my feminist beliefs means that I legitimize the stupidity found within the movement, something that can be found within any movement.

"&gt; Most men are not coddled in society. Quite the opposite. My point as that women have been conditioned to depend on men and feel entitled to special treatment and consideration.

I mean, maybe I'm coming from a different perspective, but I just never see this in the aggregate.  I see a standing assumption that women are incapable - physically, mentally, socially - and that men are socially obligated to step in and take over.  At the same time, when a group of women come together to organize an event or execute a task without a dude hovering over their shoulders they don't seem to perform any worse than their male peers.

I also see folks around here confusing excessive politeness with charity or coddling.  ""Why should I open a door for a woman?  Why should I buy her dinner?""  Probably because you're trying to suck up to her.  Of course, I see people pulling the same shit around men in higher positions of authority (bosses, parents, etc).  Kowtow.  Offer gifts or extra efforts to win favor.  You see this shit in politics all the time.  And it tends to happen when the object of tribute has something that the gifter/kowtower wants.

If you find yourself acting like a supplicant or a suck-up, that's definitely a problem... for you.  But if it's a cross-gender problem for your social circle it's more likely than not because they've got it ingrained in their heads that women are better than them, not that they're worse."

Opening a bag is also just a click - a few hundred (or thousand) times - people still want a way to consume stacks because even though it is ""just a click"" those additional clicks are not necessary and serve no purpose other than wasting your time(or killing your mouse/giving you carpal tunnel syndrome)

"Borsigs (and other tanks that rely on camo)  actually have to understand spotting/ bush mechanics, and actually risk getting spotted when they fire. KV2s and the like have to actually be in battle to do their damage and actually risk dying, not to mention that anyone with half a brain rushes a kv2 while it reloads.

And of course, none of these tanks can fir over cover at you from inside base"

About sniping, this map isn't sniper-friendly I agree with you. You have to be a really good sniper to work it out good on that map. I saw you use Her Benevolence. I know everybody says it's a good sniper, it really is, but learn to get headshots first. I suggest praedyth's revenge or one of this archetype so that 2 bodyshots come quicker. Or use HB and quickly switch to your primary to finish If you hit a bodyshot."

"Are you a lefty? If you're not, you probably have a super open stance. Try closing your stance. A regular shaft won't eliminate a slice, but when you use a shaft too stiff for you, its hard to miss left (as righty).

A three hybrid is about 20 degrees, while a 3 wood is anywhere from 14.5 to 15.5, so you will hit the three wood much further, probably 230-240. The hybrid will go maybe 200-210.

The best thing to do with wedges is try them out. I have a Vokey 54 and 60, but I wish I got Cleveland wedges. No matter what clubs you get, try them out.

A slice can be caused by an open stance, when you aim left of your intended target, too tight of a grip, putting the ball too far forward in your stance, and other swing stuff. "

"Earlier this season, I played 2-3 games in a row with 4 man premades.  We got shitstomped every game.  Each time, the 4 man premade started raging at me, the sole outsider, said they'd report me, and usually asked the other team to report me as well.  Immediately after the last game (so pretty obviously an automated system, no human review), I get chat restricted for some stupidly short time, like 3 games.  Whatever, it's over really quickly.  I'm surprised since that's the first punishment I've *ever* received of any sort in this game and I've been playing since season 1 with something like 4000 games played, and I've certainly encountered plenty of asshole premades in that time (some of which do the typical rage when losing and report the outsider) but I guess getting a few of them in a row was enough to kick me over the threshold.  My behavior is generally fine, and those games weren't any exception, I was just unlucky enough to be paired with some premade jerks a few games in a row.


So apparently, some toxic asshole premades can take away my season awards by ganging up on me and reporting me.  Great system."

"Because they don't want anyone to spend time in the rooms.

"Flight attendants basically get paid per flight. The fight is paid based on its estimated time. So if the flight is usually six hours then you get paid six hours whether the winds are good and you get there in 5 or you get delayed and it takes 7. Although if you are delayed a really long time then you get ""delay pay"" which is time and a half for all the hours you are delayed. But you only get that after a really long time. Wife is a flight attendant and she's only gotten paid for a delay once. And in those situations you've been delayed so long you would still rather just be home."

"Judging from your story you can't trust your family. It's a really good thing you opened your own bank account, I would start depositing money on that as quick as possible so that they can't do anything with it.

If I were in your situation I would search help with friends or colleages. You don't have any savings so you can't offer them any money to get them to let you stay with them. However I think the best possibility is to keep on working at your jobs and start saving money. 

Eventually (if you build some savings) I would start asking around for people at your university if people need a roommate (I mean aren't all students in need for a roommate because it makes life cheaper and more fun?).

Also fun fact, when (back then completely unknown) Parker and Stone showed up to do the film the commissioner had failed to mention that there's no script at all. Parker and Stone had to improvise a script in an hour and then direct Spielberg, Stallone, Michael J. Fox etc. And it's amazing.

"Jag tittade igenom videon och det är några saker som gör att jag väljer att ta bort den.

Den första anledningen är att den inte tillför något nytt i diskussionen, det finns alltså inget diskussionsvärde i den jämfört med andra videos och länkar som fyller new varje dag. Hade OP skrivit något i stil med; Jag tycker detta är X därför att det är Y, och på så sätt förklarat vad det är som ska diskuterats hade jag förmodligen inte tagit bort den.

Den andra anledningen är att det inte är en trovärdig källa på det sättet att en riktig dokumentär tar upp båda mynten i storyn. Nu får man, förmodligen, en väldigt vinklad nyhet om tiggarnas situation. Det behöver inte vara en vinkling som gör att situationen är felaktig, bara det att den kan vara vinklad på ett sätt som gör det till sk. sensationsjournalistik.

As our western culture may see it as pathetic over there it's a million dollar industry, as sex toys ever become more and more realistic the need for sex from a women isn't a major deciding factor anymore. People in Japan aren't getting into relationships because of the need for pleasure isn't there, they've filled their void with other things and are actually quite satisfied with it. They believe the pressure from a relationship is too much and would rather fuck a sex toy and use VR. The women in champion claim that men are too busy in their hobbies and need to spend more time and money with women but the men didn't make a sink about it, they just didn't get into relationships by choice.

"paging /u/thatbatteryguy.

From one of his previous comments on the sub:

&gt; In 5 years, it's tough to say. The most promising materials for the next generation of car batteries are lithium- and manganese-rich oxides (Li1.2Mn.53Co.13Ni.13O2) and lithium sulfur. Both face significant material and scale-up hurdles which will probably not be met within 5 years. Lithium sulfur is much more energy dense and is a viable ""holy grail"" battery technology, but I don't see it being commercialized anytime soon.

&gt; The CTO of Tesla, JB Straubel, made some very interesting comments recently that vehicles built 10 years from now could have twice the range of current vehicles. I think this is incredibly optimistic; there are intrinsic material limits which are being reached with current lithium-ion materials. But I won't pretend to know more than JB and Tesla's combined R&amp;D so it's possible they anticipate a breakthrough with another class of materials, of which the most likely candidate is sulfur.

&gt; The other obvious factor is the reduction in battery costs resulting from Tesla's gigafactory. Even without factoring in advancements to existing LIB technology, current materials should become much more viable by virtue of reduced manufacturing and processing costs.

As for your question: 

&gt; What's keeping them from being in the next Tesla?

I think they know they can bring the cost down of Li-ion enough for the Model 3, while sulfur is still murky in term of volume production. Probably still safer to focus on li-ion. "

"I'm still confused white you associate me with some redneck trash. Is it because I'm young, well educated and not a liberal? Sounds to me like you're being prejudice. 

I'm all for making schools better, but changing America start with educating the young about these things. For instance- safe sex prevents the spread of STD's and pregnancy. If kids were taught this maybe *my* tax dollars wouldn't be supporting as much welfare.

Offering money (such as welfare) to people will not help them. There are 2 ways to get it done

1) Educate the people and help them get decent jobs. Instead of raising fast food minimum wage how about we help them strive to get a better job then Wendy's? I would **not** mind spending more money on doing this because it will lower unemployment for the future and help America as a country.

2) Choke these fucking people out and let people starve and suffer on the street. This is obvisouly the unfavorable choice because it would lead to civil uproar but all civil disturbances end eventually. Maybe if you were on welfare and saw your neighbor starve to death because he wasn't earning money you'd get off your ass and get a job.

Either way, neither one of these will ever come into play. Politicians love welfare it's what gets them votes and keeps them in office. If they increase welfare people will vote to increase their salaries.

Again, open you fucking eyes to the world and stop pretending like everything is okay when it really isn't."
"I would definitely say that American cars have come a long way from true older counterparts, but European cars have such a large reputation that it will be hard to overcome.

As a downside though, the American performance cars are much less unique (there are 15+ Stingrays in my surrounding neighboorhoods) and European cars feel much more special and worthy of the extra price.

"Hi, FRC /FTC mentor here! 

&gt;What sort of costs would we expect if looking to buy such a machine?

It depends on how much machine you want. A lot of teams have Tormach mills, which are a fantastic hobby/home machine, and start around $8,000 I believe, and can go up to about $15,000 if you get a lot of options and tooling. There are cheaper machines out there though if you look around. 

&gt;What could we do with one?

In an FRC setting, a CNC mill is sort of a luxury. You can build very good, effective robots without them. They're a tool like any other, and they won't instantly make your bots 120% better. Competitions are won by strategy and design, not fancy manufacturering. 

Don't feel that you *need* to get a machine. 

That said, CNC Mills are great when you want to get into more advanced robot features, such as swerve drives or custom gearboxes. They give you the ability to easily make precision parts, and to mass-produce those parts. 

For something like a swerve drive this is handy because you need four modules, plus spares. There are going to be a lot of complex parts in those modules, and making them all by hand would be a major pain. 

My FTC Team used our little mill to make the major components of our modular drivetrain, which saved a ton of time laying out and drilling holes by hand.

&gt;What sort of training would we need / could a team of high-schoolers operate such a machine?

This is where it gets tricky. The amount of training needed really requires a mentor to be around helping you as you work. 

Partially because it's a pretty complex process, but mostly because it can be a very dangerous one. I don't feel comfortable leaving my students alone while they run it, or even leaving them in the supervision of mentors who aren't experienced with CNC machinery. 

If you don't have any machinist mentors, you may want to see if you can't recruit some from local shops or engineering companies. 

Another option you may want to consider is a higher-end CNC router, instead of a mill. 

Routers basically trade rigidity (strength) for work area. They can't cut steel like a mill can, but FRC bots are 95% aluminum anyway, so that's not really a problem. The advantage is they can have massive work envelopes, so you can cut huge plates for the bot (like belly pans or side panels). 

This allows you to get into sheet metal construction, which has massive benefits in the FRC world in saving you weight and volume. 

We're currently working on building a sweet CNC router with the help of a couple sponsors. Just gotta bring the money together. 

Any other questions feel free to reply/pm me. It's very possible I'll remember something else to say that I left out of this wall of text.

"I watched the whole doc and remember that segment.

I have to say I'd agree as well. I think the larger issue has less to do with any particular organization and more to do with the general impotence of Americans to fight back due to industrial capital's ability to 'produce the goods'. 

No organizational strategy would have 'worked'. As Herbert Marcuse and many others put it, the US was completely 'bought off' and remains more so today than it ever was.

It's a very depressing conclusion to come to, but every passing day it seems far more likely that civilization will completely collapse before passing into a higher stage. The tragedy of SDS, The Black Panthers, and hell, even the experience of the USSR is the realization that there is no 'dialectical guarantee' of a better world. Sometimes the bad guys are stronger, and the stronger ones win."

"&gt;Iran literally poses no threat to the United States, only Israel.

They have been responsible for the deaths of over 800 Americans in [acts of terrorism prior to 9/11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_and_state-sponsored_terrorism#Other_allegations).

&gt;They are pushing hard to get the United States involved in another middle east war to do the bidding of Zionists In Jerusalem.

Here's what Netanyahu actually says: ""The more people know about the deal, the more the deal's supporters try to stifle serious debate with false claims in efforts to delegitimize criticism. There is one claim that is the most outrageous. That those who oppose this deal want war. We don't want war."" Netanyahu claims that this deal is what will lead to a war, and a stronger deal or increased sanctions would better avoid that war than this deal. Israel is the one that will lose if there is a war with Iran. A war that actually wiped out their nuclear capability will kill millions of Iranians, and they would heavily retaliate against Israel, a small country which can be devastated by small terrorist groups nevermind one of the most capable armed forces on the planet.

&gt;If North Korea was Muslim or had significant oil reserves, the Neoconservative's would be beating the war drums with them instead of Iran.

North Korea is heavily protected by China, and they got their nukes already. They aren't doing much to destabilise other countries, they're mostly isolationist. Iran is seeking to dominate its region and if it gets nukes then a bunch of other countries will need to get them to rebalance things. Do you want to live in a world where a half dozen theocratic Islamist states have nuclear weapons? If Iran already had its nukes there'd be nothing we could do about it. They don't have them yet, so we can take steps to ensure they don't develop them. America is allied with the vast majority of Muslim countries in the world. To pretend the USA is at war with Islam is utterly absurd. Pakistan is an Islamic country with nukes, they are the ones that helped North Korea develop them, and they received $83 billion in US aid, including a lot of military aid. So much for your bs hypothetical that we only oppose Iran because they're Muslim. Iran is the one that is hostile and chants death to America. If Iran actually wanted to be a US ally they would be welcomed."

"Being a content creator, you especially should realize: 15 seconds of someones time or the amount of effort it takes to close an overlay ad is an almost effortless way to donate money to a Youtube content creator.

Youtube ads seems like such a great way to shift funds and power into the hands of the smaller guy, and to be honest, everyone's got a fair shot to get in on it. But it doesnt help if everyone is only out for their own and is never willing to view (what I consider to be) a quick ad.

"I'm checking up on the forums right now to see what's going on.  The older bug has since been patched so you shouldn't experience it now.  But if you DID, it was when you talked to that NPC during part 1 and you got teleported to the upper left hand side of the screen.  If you did, the developer has said it may mess with the game so I'm unsure at the moment if that's WHY I'm experiencing this problem.

Edit: It's since been fixed, it was not due to the bug I encountered.  However that bug did stop me from finishing the game but luckily the dev communicated that to me.  Just to reiterate that bug has been patched as of yesterday morning so there's no need to worry if that was keeping you from playing the game.  I restarted and skipping most of the dialogue made catching up pretty quick and painless."

"A friend of ours visited me and my wife recently, he is same age, early 40s, but holy beetus, the number of pills he has to take every day was surprising. The guy has got extremely nice personality and he is quite smart too, but he is like 260-280lbs at 5'9'' or so and it was sad to see how much medication he needs just to get through the day.

He was still obese 12 years ago (we were together in grad program in US) but without all the medication, at least I didn't notice any. It was really scary to see how much damage a bad lifestyle can do in such short period of time.

I had to pace myself when we went out and we had to take cabs more often and I was genuinely sad for him. I did try to gently encourage him taking better care of his health, but wasn't going to push it too hard.

It gets embarrassing. It will change once we stop feeling so inferior as a civilization. Such great past and still people feel super inferior on the global scale. Why?
"&gt; why are you so sure they are not inevitable

Because people can choose not to rape. It's not like rape is essential for having kids. It's not like harvesting food causes rape. *All* food harvesting causes death.

&gt; Certainly they will not be eliminated any time within the near future, hence we try to reduce them.

Never have I heard of a group trying to *reduce* rape.

&gt; And even if were, there are a thousand more reasons people suffer. Bereavement, angst, envy, falling over and injuring oneself.

Sure. If you're an emo kid. Most people don't 'suffer' from envy though. Or 'suffer' from a stubbed toe. 

&gt; ""In a just war, sometimes you have to kill humans for the greater good. Therefore, it's okay to kill and harm humans.""

Harvesting food doesn't inevitably cause war.

&gt; balance 

Ha. Good one. Because if there was a word that didn't describe the state of things as they are, whether vegan or not, it would be 'balance'.

&gt; Probably not as much as humans value one another.

So the disabled are free game?

&gt; Speciesism is the arbitrary preferential treatment of some species over others, for no reason beyond species membership.

Exactly. You get all the first world luxuries at the cost of animal life because you're life is apparently more valuable.

&gt; Why? That's an impossible task. However, the rule of thumb that ""the fewer the better, ceteris paribus"" is quite achievable.

Uh-huh. And how many is too many?

&gt; Even though large numbers of people going vegan would undeniably help the situation, we still shouldn't because it wouldn't cure all of the world's ills by itself?

Mass extinction is an ill now? You just want to keep moving towards annihilation?

&gt; but it's a step in the right direction

A step in a delaying direction while ignoring the right one.

"No matter how you build your deck it's going luck based just by the nature of draws. The mechanic has existed in other card games, most notably MTG where they were cards where you both revealed the top card of your deck and things happened. 

Unstable Portal is potentially garbage RNG. 

This is RNG you can control and it effectively becomes teching for a deck that might be just a bit faster (or a lot) than you. Not only that, but some of these cards the swings aren't that drastic. 

A 1/2 for 1 kinda sucks, but you won't have your pants down, especially against aggro that might have a 2/1 lying around. A 2/3 for 1 without the downside of Chow is a card that won't be completely dead in the late game and can actually get damage in if your opponent doesn't play anything. That card is about a half mana swing of tempo in both directions. Sure RNG might suck sometimes, but it's not even pure RNG. Especially if you design your deck to have more spells/weapons as early drops.

"Mastering is just the final touch on a final mix. So you probably don't want to send all your drum channels to the mastering engineer :)

However there are two types of mastering processes. Most replies here only cover the stereo 2-track mastering which is definitely the most standard mastering process.

But if the engineer is comfortable with it, I normally prefer stems mastering. When doing stems mastering the engineer is provided the complete mix but in 5-6 stereo stems. Depending on genre they could vary but normally for pop these stems are drums, bass, synths, guitars, vocals and fx. For EDM stuff the kick is in a separate stem. This allows for the engineer to do some corrections to the mix if something sticks out after a final round of compression/limiting for example. Or alter the width of the fx buses only etc. I find it a real time saver since most of the bad stuff that comes up in a mastering session is mixing errors, and this way most of them can be fixed without bouncing a new mix.

My 5 cents on the issue, little bit OT but hey, still related :)"

"I wasn't trying to find a passage denouncing slavery, I was showing how even masters were ordered to treat their slaves justly. You're right that the Bible never denounces ""slavery,"" but you're missing my point. If Christ had denounced ""slavery,"" then it would have discredited a lot of his teachings, and here's why: 

It is a fact that ""slavery"" was a more collective term back then. I realize that sex slaves and oppressed slaves are included, my point there was showing how slavery was still a *collective* term, so Jesus preaching against slavery as a whole would also mean he was against the other non-oppressive ideas as well (servants and apprentices), which he wasn't. Service is a vital part of the Catholic message and if Jesus spoke against work without pay, then it would discredit himself, as he commanded his followers to love and serve God obediently without question and to be servants of the world. I understand there are scriptures on how to beat your slaves, mostly prominent in the Torah, which was Mosaic law. I explained in my first post on why this is no longer followed. The new testament focuses on slaves being subservient and obedient to their master's will, just as we are to God. Because ""slavery"" referred to ""work without pay"" rather than ""forcing work and oppressive conditions upon a group of people"" like it does today, slavery is never denounced. We are all meant to be ""slaves"" to God.

As for my comment about some people being sold into servitude over death, the Catholic faith puts the sacredness of human life on a huge pedestal. If putting someone to work meant saving their life, then it's accepted (to an extent, of course). Human life is to be protected and kept sacred. Compare to how Oscar Schindlar put a large number of Jews through harsh working conditions in order to save their lives. I understand that not all slavery situations were noble, but Jesus never advocated for that. Christians are to be servants to the world and Jesus makes that perfectly clear. 

If you disagree that ""slavery"" was not a looser term back then, then you have clearly never read the Bible.

An excellent article that explains what I am trying to can be found here:

We've played TWO games in the league. Last season they won the league AND the league cup
"Not sure which example you're asking for here - so I'll give them all a go.

It's a condemnation of how Blizzard acted with Warlords as the article is effectively saying ""don't share inside development, here's why"". It's basically advocating a marketing release of information. With Warlords, most of the ""gotchas"" came from an Open QA and excitement for the expansion from the Blizzard development team. They shared too much information, and it came back to bite them.

BUT the article is flawed, in my opinion. To take it's first point as an example, the reverse is ""You always get a second chance at a first impression."" If everything was based on first impression, Warlords would be heralded as the greatest expansion of all time as the starting experience in Warlords is incredible, and WoW would have 30 million subscribers as the first impression of WoW is amazement. Conversely, no one would have come back to Warlords after leaving WoW, as they would never have given WoW a second chance. It is the same for communication. You can openly communicate about development, letting players know how much your game is changing, and then they can make their own decisions based on more relevant information.

Finally, the last point in the article highlights the pretentiousness of the article. It suggests that players are on average a mob, and generalizes them as people that don't care. Not only is this statistically inaccurate, as the people in gaming is aging on average, but it also undercuts their own experience. I am a software developer myself - I understand the inner workings of software development, and your average workplace is, underneath, just as complicated. I wouldn't ask the WoW team for Farahlon, I'd ask them why decisions regarding cut content are made.

Finally, I just want to add that if you want a good example of communication: the Hearthstone team actively participates with loads of whys, clarifications, etc. Hearthstone is a very different game design from WoW, but it's much more fluid communication is something that should be completely transferable."

"A Créole religion common in the more French sections of the south. Various African cultural beliefs began to fuse with the catholic/Christian beliefs of their slave owners who were pressing their beliefs onto the slaves. There are many different types of Créole religions, languages, and cultures. Créole culture isn't limited to the African slaves. Spain's colonization created a lot of forced cultural and voluntary cultural conversion and blending.

Santeria, is a Spanish/West African Créole religion that started in the Caribbean. It has common rituals such as animal sacrifice, songs, dancing, and followers falling into a trance. A lot of the things scared white people apply to voodoo curses. "

"This shit has been talked to death, they could introduce any number of mechanics like minimum turns played before coins are paid out, whatever, I really just don't want to play against the fucking AI anymore.

If the game has such few players at high ranks that win-trading is a thing, it's doomed anyway- it's kind of a moot point. Implementing a system where at best you waste your loyal players' time *every single match* (I'm streaming daily, feel free to have a look how many games end with concessions, you'll find me on twitch), and at worst both players lose, is not a solution to anything, it's plain ridiculous.

I understand it's not exactly the same system as in HS and thus problematic, but this is a problem with the overly-generous rewards, and the onus to solve this is not upon us. For all I care, they can halve the rewards for ranked play, as long as there's no more AI.

"I was a hotel housekeeper. We had a young couple (maybe early 20s) check in. They stayed a week or so. They kept their Do Not Disturb sign on the whole time, meaning I couldn't go in even if they were out— they just collected towels and TP from me if they needed it. I was starting to dread their room because typically, people aren't very clean when they're in hotel rooms, so if housekeeping isn't allowed in, it's a mess. 

So check-out day comes and they extend their stay, BUT they went out and put the sign up for me to go in. I walk in.... And the toilet literally contains a mountain of used TP. It was piled so high it was at the seat. Basically, they'd been using the toilet for a week without flushing, I guess it had gotten clogged and instead of plunging it or calling me to, they just kept using it. I don't even want to imagine what it looked like under the toilet paper. 

I called my boss up to the room and showed her. She said we'd have to put some gloves on and dig the TP out by hand. I refused because you do not pay me enough to dig someone's waste out with mg hands. So I held the garbage bag while she did ;) then ran to stick my head out the open window because I was about to be sick. Oh, and she told them when they returned that they were checking out today and could find somewhere else to go. They were pissed. They also insisted the toilet was clogged when they arrived and it wasn't their doing. Which is absolutely bull, because when anyone arrives and finds something off, they complain to try and get a discount.

TL;DR hotel guests used toilet for a week without flushing. Refused, let boss clean it. We kicked them out. "

"Make sure your cage has at least enough places to hide for your rats (+1).  And then respect their impulse to hide (don't disturb them when they are hiding for at least the first two **months** that you own them).  Following food and water, security is a primary need for rats.  Once they feel secure, only then can they start to get their brave on.

I don't recommend picking them up until they come to you - either into your hand, or perched at the door of their cage.  If they don't get that close, just play hand games (swish your fingers together, scratch their chin, give them treats).  Let them decide when they are ready to progress to the next stage of interaction.

Use patience and consistency to build your bond with your rats.  They will need time, because they are prey animals, and you look an awful lot like a hungry predator.  Overriding the prey response can take weeks or months (my girls still dislike being held after 3 months of work, and I pick them up for snacks every day - and it's okay)."
"&gt;They told Najib's lawyers to learn to read the articles. I've read it and there's nothing in that article that states that the money came from 1MDB, only ""unidentified sources""

Yup, that's why Najib's lawyers sent that letter of clarification. Even though WSJ *implied* that the money came from 1MDB by releasing the article, WSJ didn't state that explicitly. If Najib immediately sued them, WSJ will simply say ""But we didn't accuse you of stealing from 1MDB! It's the readers that make their own conclusions!"" and they'll be home free. And that's why I said WSJ chickened out. Or smart enough not to get caught with their pants down.

Btw, do you now admit that WSJ didn't accuse Najib of stealing from 1MDB but it is yourself that concluded that Najib stole from 1MDB when you read that article?

&gt;And really? He wanted to take out all the critics in one sweep? While he was thinking of that, that 1 month of bad PR sure was worth it I guess. He would rather let the whole issue go into chaos by letting so many people draw their own conclusions than clearing it once and for all?

Well, that's what happened. In exchange for bad press for a month, he promptly defeated all of his opponents inside his own party. Now whether that was worth it or not, we gotta wait until GE14.

&gt;Furthermore, what's stopping BN from bulldozing the law? Even if the opposition opposes the law, it will still go through because they have the majority.

BN doesn't have 2/3rd majority. But likewise, I believe BN also prefers that the law doesn't pass (money mah). But well, looks like the opposition forced their hand apparently. And like I said, all I want is that the law pass, that's it.

&gt;And my last point is simply saying how did Najib himself got a big lumpsum of RM2.6 billion donation from two transactions(IIRC) while Obama himself raised around the same amount with so many individual contributions.

Yes, and I don't see any problem with that? Please clarify why you think that's bad, or why are you bringing that up."

the fact that by a ""slip up"" you verbalize/write something, it doesn't mean is false or it was something that you where **not** thinking, in fact by ""slip up"" you are admitting that the idea that she is ""obsessed"" was already floating around your subconscious, unbeknownst to you."

"I'm gunna stand on a limb here, as I feel like it's not an opinion that is greatly shared.

I suspect that if you watched the movie first, you'll probably like the movie better. Much the same way that had you read the book first, you'd probably still like the movie, but not as much as you like the book.

Personally (and again, this could be because of my personal bias at having seen the movie first in theatres and experiencing the visceral, empathic adventure that the film was) I like the movie better than the book. Leaps and bounds more. 

Granted, there are a few parts of the movie that make more sense having read the book, but some of the plots have also undergone changes to make the movie work. I have seen the movie at least 7-10 times, and I have read the book all the way through twice and listened to it on audiobook twice, and I have to say that hands down, for me, the movie is better. 

it's not a common opinion, I know, but like some have said already in this thread, it helps to treat them as two totally different and distinct works of art, instead of just seeing them as the source material and the slightly altered finished filmic product."

"We've intentionally hit all of two people this year, and it was in one series.  Everything you people keep saying is a norm happened in one series.  Against the Jays? Down by 2 with them hitting us everywhere you think we deliberately put someone else on base? That doesn't make sense.  

Wade Davis pointed out that every time you pitch outside we get shelled against them.  We started pitching inside and guess what, it worked.  Until late in the game, Volquez had given up only 3 runs.  You have to pitch inside to these guys because if you don't, they hit you all over the place.  But when you pitch inside you have a bigger risk of hitting someone.  And whether Jays fans want to admit it or not, objectively the Jays do crowd the plate.  And they do it because it often forces people to throw away which nets them more hits.  We didn't hit them intentionally.  We just didn't.  Up and inside is not the same as hitting someone.  And thats what people are acting like.  Like it was just a miss.  It wasn't.  It was pitching inside to get him off the plate.  Smart pitching.  You don't get to bitch about NOT being hit by a pitch, and you sure as fuck don't get to retaliate for NOT getting hit by a pitch! "

"examine indicates that milk thistle

&gt;  May increase the rate of protein synthesis in liver cells and encourage subsequent repair after injury to the cells and enhanced DNA synthesis has been observed in rats with a partial hepatectomy (missing parts of the liver) but failed to be observed in healthy controls or hepatoma/neoplastic cells.

So the evidence suggests that milk thistle likely plays some role in liver repair. If I were concerned about liver damage I'd take it in addition to NAC for added liver antioxidant protection

**Description:**  Known to take the form of nearly any worship him, The Huntsman is usually humanoid and often dressed as one who lives off the land and always accompanied by two beasts, the apex predators of the area, while wearing something made from the primary prey animals of the same area; his eyes and upper face are usually obscured or at least inhuman.  He carries The Weapon of the Wilds, a survival tool that suits his environment.  
The Master of Beasts holds most mortals as little more than spokes that turn along the circle of life though those that are particularly determined may win his favor and survive and even thrive, if they're strong enough to fight for it.  Those who remember him when struggling for mastery of the beasts of the world are surely shown favor.

"This one comes from my dad:

There was a Jesuit priest that taught at his high school, he used to teach the down and out kids as well as the high school. And there was this one young filipino boy that was always thirsty for knowledge. At the time, all the high schoolers and staff recieved a nice watch (i think it was gold plated or something like that).

Either way, the young filipino boy was so happy recently that he had finally learned to tell time, so the Jesuit priest gave the young boy his watch and told him now he can practice his skill at telling time. Years went on, and sadly the priest passed away recently.

At the funeral, the young filipino boy (who was now a successful lawyer) went up to his casket and went to lay the watch with the priest. Another priest, a good friend of the watch giver, took the watch and handed it back to the filipino. He said, he knew the story of who the watch went to, and the best thing to do that priests memory is to give that watch to another, so that maybe he will be encouraged to follow his passion for knowledge as well.

My father says he will never forget the look on the filipino man's face as he began to tear up. "

"&gt; Why are numerical results important? Isn't the educational achievement of the pupils what we are interested in?

how do you suggest we *measure* that?


&gt;Right... because those students aren't there anymore so don't need to be funded.

Yes, so the students that cost the least to educate and bring in the same amount of money leave. That's the entire point, you make it more difficult for other schoolds. 

&gt;Ok so before the lower achieving children were eating up the money that was there to teach the clever children? Seems unfair to me, so this sounds like an improvement.


The function of our education system is to give everyone an education, not to give some people a better education than others. If you want *more* education you can get a tutor, go to private school, get help from your parents, attend university, attend the OU, go to afterschool clubs. 


&gt;So the children who misbehave are the ones are now the ones effected. Less children who behave are being effected by those who misbehave.


It's not about misbehaviour, it's about students who need more help than others. 

&gt;They go to the children who have learned and perform academically

"&gt; there would be no need for the EU to harm itself in trying to punish a member for leaving.. In fact it'd be counter productive

I will have to disagree with that part with passion. IF EU/EZ doesnt make some kind of example out of UK if it leaves(or any other who leaves first) then other non-EZ nations will not have any fear about leaving EU and that would result in a series of nations to leave EU. That is something that pro-federal people fear the most about this ""UK will leave"" thing. 

If UK will have hard time negotiating with EU after leaving EU then other smaller nations will not leave and only try to change EU from inside and that is what pro-EU people want.


&gt;Secondly if that were the case, the UK should leave the EU, the risk of remaining in an organisation where dissent could be seen as traitorous and potentially lead to direct action by other members to harm another would be absurd.

I would love to see UK follow that logic if/when Scotland leaves UK :) sure there would not be any ""punishment"", right?


&gt;There are far too many EU citizens living in the UK (and who will remain in the UK...) and UK citizens living in the EU for it not to... This isn't suddenly going to be an issue.

IF UK leaves I think that residence permits etc. will be valuable negotiation point for politicians especially when lot of UK´s ""shitty jobs"" are done by immigrants/foreign labor. If EU decided that anyone travelling into EU needs to have permit/visa that would hamper UK´s business pretty hard while EU is big enough to handle the problem without too much problems.(Germany etc. would suffer some but other nations GDP would compensate enough)
UK would be in serious shortage of workers soon(in 1-2 years time) and EU would have lots of extra workers that could be hired for other projects inside EU(with shittier pay of course).

&gt;I can't see that, plus the EU isn't insane..

There should be some kind of collective bargaining allowed  for customers who sign these contracts. "
no.... **NO!!!!**
"Not the person you're asking, but I'll take a shot at this.  

A lot of people think that you don't see stars and planets in space because they have simply never been in space.  

In most of the pop culture references to being in space, both video and photographs, the view from a spacecraft in orbit around the earth is the following: the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun. That's everything you can see, they think. The stars and other planets just don't appear in these images.  

The answer to this (which I imagine you already know - this is more for OC's benefit) is fairly simple with some knowledge about photography. The light from the sun that reflects off of both the Earth and Moon simply washes out the very small amount of light visible from the stars.  

For a brief example, try taking your iPhone in a dimly lit room and tell it to focus on something. It will adjust its aperture to let more light in and see that object. Now if you point a flashlight at something and have the camera focus on that, all of a sudden the dimly lit stuff around the room appears black. It's simply because the amount of light coming off of the dimly-lit objects (the stars) isn't enough for the camera to capture when there is a far brighter object (moon, Earth, Sun) right next to it.  

This isn't to say it's impossible to photograph stars in space, you just have to use time-lapse video or very slow shutter speeds. [Here's a video](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RiGeqsGjhoY) where the stars appear.  

Our eyes are much better than cameras at filtering in  small amounts of light, so the final answer is that, yes. You can see tons of stars in space - probably many more than on Earth because the atmosphere isn't in the way. That's the same reasoning why we have space telescopes.  

So I get where the question comes from. I hope this helps clear up confusion."

"This is so accurate. I always find it interesting how much people give a fuck about things that not only cannot be changed, but do not matter. Example : If my boyfriend is doing anything and messes up, say, drops the piece of chicken he was going to cook on the floor, he will audibly curse and get visually angry for like 30 minutes. However, just the other day I was making pasta and missed the strainer and poured all my noodles down the sink. I just laughed and put more noodles to boil. Sometimes we do stupid shit and fuck up, getting mad isn't going to put my noodles back in the pot, but calmly starting new water to boil will. A small example, but if it already happened, getting stressed or mad will not help the outcome in any way. Just don't give a shit and all will be well."

"They were good matches but to call them career-defining moments is a bit much. His match with HBK was what I considered to be the last remarkable one.

He got concussions just from doing regular moves. That's why his match with Bray was extremely forgettable, they protected him so hard, and if that's what they have to do every time he gets in the ring then I'm simply not interested."

"I highly disagree (politely). New players get hooked based on games where they are on the winning side of high variance. If a player plays 3 games that are all very similar but ""fair"", they will extrapolate that to be the entire game and are more likely to walk away from it because its not exciting. But a game where they see crazy awesome spells* will excite them about the game and make them want to explore more of it. New players are more resilient to loss than you give them credit for. Remember that though everyone in this thread seems to agree with this sentiment, this is a very hardcore focused group of players since they have opted to join an online community focused around the game. We are unlikely to find the type of player duels is really focused at here.

I remember at one point in our relationship we got into a discussion about pubic hair and what we like.  She said she liked it when a guy was trim but she hated it when they were completely hairless and I told her what I like.  After this I sent her a picture of my junk to seriously ask her if my trim was good, And she sent me one of herself to ask me if hers looked good.  Aside from that our friendship was completely platonic.  "

He brought Mariota in as a hail mary to keep his job. The safest/smartest thing would be trade down and actually acquire some pieces to build up a team. Instead he's probably gonna trash another young qb's career due to his own greed/impatience.
Smith has one career playoff win from what I see. So just purely by the number (1 to 0) you are right. Lol. Take Alex Smith all you want. He'll give you 3500 yards and 18 touchdowns every year. He's very solid but Stafford's skill set and ceiling is so much higher. I'll keep my guy.

"This happened to me and my boyfriend last March.

We were staying one night in an old hotel in San Francisco that was kinda creepy, but the room was nice and affordable so we just thought whatever. The next morning he and I were going downstairs to check out and we see this Asian guy in a white button down shirt going into the elevator, we run and ask him to hold it but he lets the doors close anyway so we just shrug and press the button.

Then, I'm not exaggerating at all, within 5 seconds the same elevator opened again, we got in thinking the dude maybe pressed the door open button or something but it was *fucking empty*

When we started going down I was super confused and wondering if there was some kind of prank being pulled, so I was looking around for a secret little hidey hole or something the guy could hide in and my boyfriend said ""we DID both see him come in here right???"" I asked him what the guy looked like to make sure we saw the same thing and he said what I posted above, Asian guy in a white button down shirt.

Now I'm sure the elevator didn't move, they were old and made a lot of noise when in motion and I didn't hear a damn thing when the doors shut with him inside. 

And I didn't tell my boyfriend this either at the time, but when we got inside the elevator I swore I saw the guy come around the corner in the hall before the doors closed, and he was giving us both a mean look. 

Edit: the place is called Hotel Whitcomb, it's pretty fucking old and one of the staff people was a giant douchebag, but my boyfriend and I had a good time and the room was clean and bug free. 8/10 would be haunted again.

"Well first, get rid of your three striker frontline. They will not win you games against even mediocre backlines.

Second, save that beelzebub. You don't know where you want it yet.

Third, evolve your kuma to a five star and save it. Beatrice and Sharr (Yes, that means I would not recommend Vitos.) are too close to their 5* exp cap. It would be a waste of a lot of free exp. Save it for either your legendary or for when you special train one of your strikers. A 5 star kuma is almost enough to go from 1 to 50.

I can't tell you WHICH of the two you should move forward with, as both are very good. Just don't use both. At least not on the same team. Also, wait on that legendary. You might not even like the one that you get."

"Much too late to be read, but I had several crushes growing up.

One became a lawyer for the Obama administration and lives in Washington D.C. I haven't seen her since high school, but I unfriended her on Facebook because we never talk.

One still lives in the area we grew up. I haven't seen her in a few years, but we're friends on Facebook. She got married a few years ago. She also gained a serious, serious amount of weight after high school. Looking back, I did have one or two opportunities to hook up with her that I missed, but I'm not regretful.

The other ""significant"" crush I had, I stopped talking to her about 13 years ago when I realized it was never going to happen. We reconnected a few years later and were at least chatty with each other. I recently blocked her on Facebook because she's seriously, unbelievably racist. Coincidentally, she's really good friends with the 2nd crush I wrote about. That crush married a black guy, which generally speaking amuses me a lot.

I don't hold any candles for my past crushes. I suppose the point of a crush is to put someone on a pedestal and desire them. I see my former crushes as people, flaws included. Besides, I've been married for 9 years to the most amazing woman I've ever met. "

"* Be there for her. Spend time with her, as much as your schedule (and hers) allows. This is the most important. 

* Let her know that she can tell you *anything*. Do not yell at her or shame her when she comes to you with news you don't want to hear (whether it's ""I broke something in the living room,"" or ""I got a bad grade,"" or ""I'm pregnant."") 

* Obviously, don't be abusive to her in any way. Or, to anyone else.

* Be there to guide her, but let her make mistakes.

* Don't chase her boyfriends (or girlfriends) away, and don't make cracks about ""getting the shotgun.""

* I saw a meme floating around on Facebook recently about how it's not a father's duty to teach his daughter how to be a lady, but how she should be treated. That is true. 

* Value and praise her for her achievements and talents, not *just* her looks. Teach her to find validation not from an external source, but from herself. 

* Treat her mother with respect and kindness, whether you are with her mother or not. And *never* badmouth her mother within earshot of her, or let her see you hurting her mother.

* [Do not make her vow her virginity to you, or to anyone else.](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2011/09/purity-balls-theyre-barking-up-the-wrong-tree.html) Let her have agency over her body and what she chooses to do/not do with it. Remember that what she does or does not do with her body is *not* a reflection on you, or your parenting skills, or any of that. Nor for that matter is it a reflection of her worth as a human being. And make sure she is armed with *medically and scientifically-accurate* knowledge so she can make informed choices. 

* If she has brothers or step-brothers, don't be stricter (or less strict) with her simply because she's a girl. If you need to be more strict with her (or for that matter, her brothers), be sure and ask yourself *why*...and be honest with yourself. Make sure it's *really* about her age or whatever else, not the fact that she's a girl. 

* [You may (in fact probably will) need to unlearn what you have learned about parenting, gender roles, etc. from your own family. That is OK.](http://www.cracked.com/article_19010_5-ways-to-avoid-your-terrible-parents-mistakes.html)

* Do not force her to worship your God(s), or to renounce any faith/religion, or ridicule her faith/lack thereof. Share your beliefs with her, by all means, but let her choose for herself what to believe/not believe, how to worship/not worship, etc.

* Do not force her into ""traditional"" gender roles and expectations. It's OK if she doesn't like dresses/pink/dolls/long hair/""playing house""/tea parties/makeup/princesses/all of the above. It's OK if she likes any or all of those things. But that has to be her choice, and hers alone. (And if she has brothers, don't force them into ""traditional"" roles, either. Don't ridicule them for liking traditionally feminine things if they so choose.)

* Do not compare her to her siblings, friends, or cousins, or to your friends' kids. (e.g. ""Why can't you be more like your sister/brother/etc.)

* [Help her cultivate a positive body image](http://www.childmind.org/en/posts/articles/2012-9-25-girls-healthy-self-esteem-confidence-body-image), in a world that puts an *immense* amount of pressure on her to conform to an impossible ideal of beauty. 

* Don't let her hear you say things like, ""You throw like a girl!"" to your sons/stepsons if you have them. You don't want either her or them to equate ""girl"" with ""weak."" Teach your sons to value and respect women. 

* Remember, she is watching and listening. Behave and speak accordingly. 

* Listen to her. Let her vent, and commiserate. Then you may offer advice, if she seems like she'd be willing to hear it.

* There is nothing wrong with buying her things...but remember, she needs your presence more than your presents.

"A level 1 Druid should work, shouldn't it?

&gt;***Goodberry***: 1st-level transmutation
&gt;
&gt;Up to ten berries appear in your hand and are infused with magic for the duration. A creature can use its action to eat one berry. Eating a berry restores 1 hit point, and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day.

So, it only takes a single first-level spell slot to feed ten people for one day.

If ""nourishment"" doesn't also include water in your mind, then that can also be solved by a single first-level spell slot:

&gt;***Create or Destroy Water***: 1st-level transmutation
&gt;
&gt;You create up to 10 gallons of clean water within range in an open container. Alternatively, the water falls as rain in a 30-foot cube within range, extinguishing exposed flames in the area.

Even considering that the adventurers wouldn't be getting any water from their food, a gallon of water a day should be plenty, so one casting should be sufficient.

Since level 1 Druids can cast two first-level spells a day, they should be able to sustain even a ten-person party by themselves."

Going to 5V appears to be no problem 80uA !  but from 5V to 3.3V I can't find anything on ebay that will do it for less than 3mA during idle.

Looks like straight to battery or through a diode is the way to go for lithium powered esp8266 (?)

EDIT:  Just found out about [MPS MP1584](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/images/4/4e/MP1584_r1.0.pdf) a step down converter that can do 5V to 3.3V at up to 3A with only 100uA quiescent current ! On top of all that , it's 1$ for a [complete pcb](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Mini-MP1584EN-DC-DC-BUCK-Adjustable-Step-Down-Module-Effect-Higher-Than-LM2596-/301668096806?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item463cd1db26)

So I guess the ""step up then down"" solution is now viable at 2.84$ with a complete solution including usb charger, cell discharge protection, 3.3v regulated power supply and a ESP12 for 6.39$, 7.15$ including a breadboard breakout for the esp12."

"Is there something wrong with liking Apple products?

I'm a huge tech person, I built my first computer when I was 14 and my major in college involved everything technology. I still prefer Apple products because I believe they tend to be better, overall. I tried Android and hated it. It's fragmented, inconsistent, and less aesthetically pleasing (in my opinion). I've owned non-Apple PCs and laptops and hated them (the computer, not the OS). On most non-Apple laptops, the trackpad alone is enough to make me want to throw it out a window. Apple's trackpad is a dream compared to any other.

Apple products are high quality and reliable, despite what a lot of redditors want you to think.

EDIT: You downvoters are pathetic. At least come up with a response."

"Like every other guide will tell you its not just about joining a DM server and mindlessly shooting anything that moves. The idea is to have a goal in mind, for example focusing on one tap headshots or instead trying to spray or burst down each foe to practice that aspect of the game.

Personally besides doing some DM in CS:GO I like to play Osu!, arguably its a 2D game so the muscle memory doesn't translate exactly but I feel like it improved my aim to some extent and its rather fun to play.

Another method that helped me was starting up a custom map with several bots and only shooting each bot once trying to get one tap headshots switching to a new target if I miss. I noticed after doing this I preformed a lot better on pistol rounds and with the AWP."

"Ill mannered brainwaves? Because that makes so much more sense. It's still just a bunch of 'science' so old, it rivals theories of night air. There is no 'statistical probability of reduced intellectual capability', they had just as much of a reason to develop more intelligence as Europeans did.

As for static minds: Again, this isn't really correct. Minds aren't 'static', they change all the time. As people age they do become less able to change, however, as I said earlier, your conditions growing up have a much greater influence on intelligence than genetics do.

Everything you read must have been written anywhere from The Dark Ages to the early 1800's, because it's all based on bunk science, or no science at all.

"the vast majority of taiwanese see retaking the mainland about as desirable as americans see invading canada, and as feasible as england sees invading america. it's a punchline, not a policy. see also ""the capital of taiwan is in nanjing!"" and ""mongolia is a sacred part of taiwan's territory!"".

if anything were to happen to cause the PRC to destabilize, the taiwanese priority would be on making sure they're not trading the devil they know for something worse, putting themselves in a favorable position for whatever is incoming (and minimizing the huge economic damage that would result, at least in the short term), and also probably the large majority of people who want to see an independent taiwan pushing the issue since the 'status quo' and 'peaceful relations' narrative would be in shambles. that wouldn't even be the first move though."

"Hi Joe,

I know contructive critiscism is important, so i'll give it a try.
I'm not a modeller, so my Feedback is more on the Rendering/Shading side of your work.

In general the renderings seem a bit dark and/or compressed. I don't know if you're using a proper linear gamma workflow and i'm also not sure wether you are using global illumination or not. For example under the desk or in the kitchen scene on top of the stove. Also, on the kitchen scene at 1:06 the shading of the wall is a bit odd, check some real world references.

Since your scenes are static, you can bake a Irradiance map and use it for your renderings.

Also the sky in the window seems to be off, it looks a bit like its just a plane with the clouds mapped on it. One possibility would be to add an hdri-dome around it, and also use it for the lighting (+interior light).

Overall the modelling (as far as i can tell) is fine.

I'm a bit short on time, so that's it for now, i hope this helps you."
"I would highly recommend Tristana for a number of reasons. In lower elos team comps are very scrambled up as most people pick their main (which should be done) or are forced to play a role they do not feel comfortable with. A wombo combo team comp and a poke team comp are difficult to pull off because of that reason and the very often lack of communication. That's why a split push comp is your safest bet. This is where Tristana fits in perfectly.

1. Her E-&gt;Q-&gt;AA can take down turrets very quickly, probably the fastest out of all ADCs.

2. Her W and R are perfect for escaping and fast getaways for when someone comes to stop your split push.

3. Her early game, even though weaker then Graves' or Cait's can be won easily with the help of some communication with your supp. Both Graves and Cait use up their mana faster than Trist. Simply let them push the wave a little and then freeze it. Your E is a passive so will not use up any mana. Use it to CS and keep your W for whenever they try to engage or you get ganked. Do not engage unless your jungler is there to gank. They will run out of mana before you making a gank easier and will have to recall before you. Push the wave as fast as you can using all your super split push power and recall.

4. Once you have your first few items and a few points in your E and Q you can start being a true lane bully/snowballer and take over Mid-Game.

5. Tristana can not only split push very very effectively but can also be brilliant in a team fight. She deals a tonne of damage with her E and empowered AAs. Can pick off carries with her W (practice required). Her W can also be used to escape easily if you get picked on. Her R can be used both as a finisher or a very effective disengage tool.

6. Her passive makes her very difficult to target in a team fight Mid to Late game.

I would highly recommend you try Tristana out as she has very high carry potential even when your team is behind and does not require a tonne of practice as Draven, Jinx or Cait might. (Im mentioning Cait because using her traps effectively requires a good bit of practice and that she becomes very hard to carry with is she doesn't win in lane. She might be the easiest to play mechanically with but requires a lot of practice to make an impact on the game).

If you want, I can review a few of your games on replay.gg and send you some suggestions and advice on your gameplay, build paths and such. PM me if you're interested."

"Uber (to me) is for: 

Travel when the night is going to end in drunkeness. 

Travel to places where the time/effort value estimation for parking is way more than cost of uber and you need to look awesome. 

Going to the airport. 

For other occasions , there is bus,train and local cabs (kaali peeli type). 

In big cities, parking and traffic may be the singular reason why people would not want to own cars. Add to that the cost of parking permits in new buildings (old ones don't even have allocated parking rather straight up street parking) might change your number estimates.  I don't see you considering parking costs so maybe you could add those numbers in. 

I own a car and yet, for the scenarios mentioned above, Uber and Ola are my last mode of preference because all said and done, they tend to be consistently unavailable when you need them the most and if they are, they are at surge pricing which makes local cabs a much cheaper and accessible mode of transport.

If you really want to and need to use both, at least use them on separate days or separate am/pm? That might help. "

"&gt; The problem is she followed that. 

You speak as if she had an alternative. If she wanted to maintain fiscal and economical stability, she just outright *had* to implement at least *some kind* of austerity policy. That's what made people so angry about her when she was running for President. Some of us knew she was flat out lying when she said there were other ways to deal with the imminent fiscal crisis. The truth is she should have started this back in 2011-2012, but had she done so, she would most certainly have lost the Presidential Elections. 

I mean, of course you can argue Levy could have cut less investments and more of the state expenses. In fact, I actually agree with that. I believe there is room to make a much better fiscal adjustment. But this could only happen if we had a strong leadership in place, because it would imply lots of public jobs being terminated and lots of interest groups would rebel. In my opinion, Dilma clearly does not have what it takes to do that, otherwise she would have done it already. That's why lots of people want to impeach her, besides the credibility crisis she's facing, due to all of the corruption scandals. 

Personally, I believe impeachment is not a very good solution, since it could lead to even greater instability and I'm a very pragmatic guy when it comes to economic issues. For instance, I don't think the alleged political benefits (which are quite uncertain in themselves) would outweight the risk of loosing the investment grade. But if she is going to stay in office untill 2018, she dam well needs to turn the table and start working pronto, lest she wants to drag the country along with her while she falls, burned at the stake by the likes of Cunha, Calheiros and Aécio.

"L5 does need to be toned down a bit from what it is currently, particularly if Darkest Dungeon is supposed to be the real end game. I get the impression from the Corpse and Hound patch notes that Red Hook got irked by the fact most players found L5 a relative stroll in the park, and turned things up to eleven during that update in response.

The PROT boosts *are* annoying. Even if you manage your 2 x gargoyle and ghoul encounter so that you don't take much damage or stress, that battle is going to trudge on forever as the terrible-but-undeniably-ripped abominations are valiantly bopped on the nose to death. It's boring, not stressful. I've actually come to love the Weald's giant because, whilst he's still a meat shield and can do ruinous things to your squad, you actually do take swings that feel juicy out of him every round. Makes me feel nostalgic.

Another turn-off which is not really mentioned is that losing a hero at that stage is a serious bummer. Putting aside anything else, you've invested a huge amount of time to get them up to that tier, and training up another one is far more unpalatable than when they're level 3. As a result in L5 I find myself playing very conservatively. Clutch situations that are supposed to make DD great rarely come up, because if the game decides to throw four crits per round as it so often does, well, I'll just take my ball and go home. Not worth it. This increases the tedious nature of the current meta at highest level."

**Kingsburg** is actually a diceplacement game.  Similar mechanic but different than vanilla worker placement.  You roll dice and then use them as your workers based on their values.  I have never played **Kingsburg** as I went with Alien Frontiers as my intro to this genre but it has since been filled off my the amazing **Voyages of Marco Polo**.

**Five Tribes** is also not worker placement.  It is Mancala.  It is also sometimes called a worker displacement game.  it is ast it's best at 3 players.  Excellent game.

**Istanbul** is a great game. I have never called it a worker placement game but I can see why it might be considered such.  It is also a pickup and deliver game.  The board is modular giving you lots of replayability."

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines.](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) If you are planning to submit your own music in listentothis, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit.](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) Violating these site-wide rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [listentothis introduction](/r/listentothis/wiki/reddiquette) to learn what this place is all about, and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment, but not submit music to listentothis. Keep in mind, if you haven't got anything positive to say in your comment, it's best not to say anything. Earning downvotes will block your comments, so comment wisely.

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit music links in listentothis. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of 50-100 submissions each day. We can't tell you what this score is. We can only tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote music in listentothis without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links.](http://www.reddit.com/advertising) These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes. Everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit faq.](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq)

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** listentothis is not the place where you want to submit your first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are however many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you, who will give you feedback and advice, even technical tips, on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*
* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources, they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in listentothis, and prove that you are not a spammer. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers. Thank you for understanding, and good luck in your music career!

"I've only ever noticed frames locked to 30 on action games where things HAVE to appear fluid. From a technical perspective this can be bothersome, but we're talking SNES era games. My ipod has better technical specifications than the SNES. There's nobody that should be complaining that they spent all that money on their two titan X cards only to be locked to 30fps on a SNES game. And it very much is a SNES game, they have just updated the sprites and textures. 

SE don't expect to make much money of the pre-PS1 era game remasters. That's obvious, if they can't cut corners in some areas then they won't bother. I mean, what's next? ""no SSAO/HBAO or FOV slider options GRRR get your pitchforks!""?"

"just to make sure we are on the same page:

atheism = does not believe there are gods and it is an absolute, no matter how they approach the question or their reasoning behind the conclusion.

agnosticism = does not claim to KNOW if there are gods or not.

As an aside, i find it funny to think that Atheists have more faith than Agnostics do lol. 

And as my point, where do you see that most INTP side with Atheism? And where are the radical ones? 

Just like the views of Agnosticism/Atheism, lines can be blurred and crossed. Just like we can blur the lines of T/J. Not all of us are 100% of either. It's a grey area. "

"If any of you are interested in delving down this particular line of reasoning,  [Francis Heylighen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Heylighen) has a lot of interesting thoughts and publications on the matter, particularly [this paper](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Superorganism.pdf) and [this paper.](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf) 

Admittedly his treatment of the Internet and such things are a bit naïve considering the paper is somewhat dated, but I'd maintain that some of the more ""formal"" system-theoretic underpinnings and analogies he works off of are still relevant.

"[HF](/s ""I repeat myself, the problem i have with the true ending is that it doesn't convey the feelings the characters have about what have been lost in the journey. And not only that, the world should be consistent in that way. The aftermatch in stories are used to show the repercusion of the characters actions along the way and HF true end does a bad job at this. The happiness comes out of nowhere and it doesn't show what effectsthe story had on the characters. Why does Ryder stays?, Why everything is happy with a normal live  when many people died along the way? Why Illya died for a cause that didn't concern her? Why Saber after following orders and helping Shirou unconditionally doesn't deserve to be saved like Sakura? That part of the story is totally forgotten in the ending. And i totally difer in your view of Kiritsugu. He doesn't reach that conclusio and Zero shows you. He finally finds that being a hero of justice and never give up in the ideal from the start is the way of saving the most people and in the long run saving the world. Something that i posted long ago about this theme: Shirou sacrifice innocents that could be considered the nameless masses. What Kiritsugu protected but ... Then what would you think if you were in the ones that were sacrificed. The nameless mass. Would you still say ""Way to go Shirou!"". Didn't you say that your life comes first? It is a hypocrite statement. A endless circle of destruction where the ones on the side that will be saved  will defend that idea that eventually will make them pass to the other side. In animal behaviour we see the protection of loved ones. A dog does it, a lion does it. But one of the things that difference humans to animals it is the willingness of devoting your life or dying to protect something greater that your existence or the others. The heroes around history show an admirable path that leave an inmortal mark of their deeds in history. That mark affects later generations and make positive impacts long after their death and that eventually can break the cycle. There is no hypocrisy in this path and because of the sacrifice or devotion of these individual the world can be saved. That is why he see the theme of heroism in Fate. Why the hell the story focus on summoning heroes from the past? Just because it's cool? Not, finally it shows that the anwser to saving the world is the heroism that people can show and that idea will be passed to later generations and finally save the world. HF is a incorrect resolution, it will not save the world so it should at least convey the feeling that not everything is alright. I don't want a character to die, but it happens that the death of Shirou conveys the theme in a really good way"")

"Objectively speaking, Beckman has done some good things off the gridiron. There was a report in the Chicago Tribune going over his time at Illinois. Team GPA is up and arrests are down compared to the Zook era. He also changed assignments in the locker room so that players with the highest GPAs would get the center spots, which are apparently the most desirable. Comparatively, the best spots in the locker room under Zook went to the players with the best stats.

"First off, I upvoted you for your explanation of ""Words are Wind"", since it was on point and very good. I didn't think it needed mentioning in a comment. however, since you whined about it... 

There are much better examples. Take for example my favorite character at the moment, Littlefinger. His words are such wind that literally everybody in the realm loves him. ok, not really, but he managed to talk his way into being a Lord Paramount of one kingdom, and regent to another, if only for a year. After he bought out most of the Vale's debt, the Lords Declarant, who attempted to oust him by force, have shrunk away to Yohn Royce and 2 people who don't matter. However, when it comes to actions, nobody reading would be surprised if he killed Sweetrobin, blamed it on Harry the Heir, and took direct control of the Vale. He betrayed Ned (if you ask me, he convinced Joffrey to kill him), killed Joffrey (okay, maybe this one isn't evil), killed Lysa, and kidnapped Sansa. But, he's just so awesome while being evil, so I can't help but love the guy.

First of all, you have to understand how Stannis talks to people. He always makes the argument that he wants the person he is talking to to refute. He talked about how much he hated Edric Storm, talked to Davos about how if he doesn't kill Edric, the world will end and millions will die, and how he could have won a battle if he had dragons. It sounds to me like he is 100% convinced that he should kill the boy. Oh, wait, Davos says that only two kings have died, so Stannis spares the boy's life. in Dance, Stannis details his entire plan to take the Dreadfort to Jon, who is quite convinced that he will attack the Dreadfort or die in the attempt. Then, Jon tells him to treat with northerners and attack Deepwood Motte. he does. obviously, he wasn't that convinced of attacking the Dreadfort as he said he was.

so, just because Stannis says reasons why he will kill Edric doesn't mean that he actually will. But, does he? Stannis recieves word that Joffrey has died. He immediately says that they must give him the Iron Throne now, until he is reminded that Joffrey has a brother. Stannis says that the kingdoms need a man to rule with the white walkers coming, and Melisandre asks for the boy again and Davos calls him Edric again:

&gt;Stannis rounded on him in a cold fury. ""I know his name. Spare me your reproaches. I like this no more than you do, but my duty is to the realm. My duty . . ."" He turned back to Melisandre. ""You swear there is no other way? Swear it on your life, for I promise, you shall die by inches if you lie.""

&gt;""You are he who must stand against the Other. The one whose coming was prophesied five thousand years ago. The red comet was your herald. You are the prince that was promised, and if you fail the world fails with you."" Melisandre went to him, her red lips parted, her ruby throbbing. ""Give me this boy,"" she whispered, ""and I will give you your kingdom.""

&gt;""He can't,"" said Davos. ""Edric Storm is gone.""

after spending three quarters of the book delaying, and finally having his stated standard of evidence (which is really high. like, prove that you can kill all my enemies by doing so is an insanely high standard of evidence for Melisandre's magical ability) met, Stannis still threatens to kill Melisandre for murder should the sacrifice not be successful. Then, Davos tells him to go to the wall to win his kingdom, so he does. in the show, Stannis sentences Davos to death for treason, but in the books, the most punishment is some halfhearted ""some might call it treason"", not ""what you just did is treason"" and then accusing Davos, of all people, of disloyalty. He then takes Davos's council and changes his entire war strategy. Huh, why would he take the council so thoroughly of a guy who had just pissed him off so much? You might be 100% convinced that Stannis was going to kill Edric from his words, but his actions scream otherwise, and ""Words are Wind"". 

but, where are you getting this idea that Stannis attacked the wall for his own benefit? according to Stannis:

&gt;Yes, I should have come sooner. If not for my Hand, I might not have come at all. Lord Seaworth is a man of humble birth, but he reminded me of my duty, when all I could think of was my rights. I had the cart before the horse, Davos said. I was trying to win the throne to save the kingdom, when I should have been trying to save the kingdom to win the throne.

and who cares why people do what they do? isn't the entire point that words are wind? but, whatever, words are wind. I'm sure that this is just a justification for his horrible actions. like, uh, saving the wall from a wildling attack. Or, maybe when he punished his soldiers for rape. He also was the only person who attempted to rescue fArya when she was being tortured. But, hey, I guess we should just ignore the actions that people take because ""Actions are Wind"", oh, wait."

"Its not so much that cb should be the number 1 option on offense, wade and goran will have the ball in there hands the most, but our offense needs to run through cb. Theres no reason why he shouldn't be involved in every play whether it be touches, a shot or even just a screen. He's one of the most versatile bigs in the league and we need to take advantage of that.

Cb should be the anchor of our offense allowing other guys to chip in as they can. So not the number 1 option per se but still the most important, and expensive,  piece to the puzzle."

"Making friends is super hard... I'm a natural introvert that pretends or appears extroverted. People think I'm super bubbly and stuff, but my first world problem (heeh!) is that I'm very shy, anxious or even disinterested and it's very hard for me to keep a conversation going with people I have nothing in common with. Thus... I have absolutely no ""real life"" friends that know I'm little - pretty much only Daddy knows, and that's that.

I think, if you have a tumblr, you could try following CG/l blogs (there are many many that are SFW) and just kind of liking their posts and helping them answer a question when they post about it or something... generally speaking, I think that's how I make friends online, like right now ahah.

I stopped using IMVU a veeeery long time ago because it got frustrating for me, but I use stuff like Line PLAY on my phone and love to play Draw Something and other games that could be passed off as ""quirky"" rather than straight up ""omg Sugars you have kiddie games in your phone you're a weirdo"".

I can only suggest that you try to reach out in ways that are only mildly out of the norm for you, but nothing that makes you super uncomfy. They say life starts at the end of your comfort zone, but facing the grown up world as a little and reaching out into the blue can sometimes yield unsightly results because people just *don't get it*.

Keep trying, friend! And feel free to message me or something and be friends, even if you send me just a cat gif I'll know you want to be friends so no need for awkward intros or small talk :3"

You might want to work on your serve mechanics to generate power from your legs  and link the kinetic chain through waist torque, shoulder turn and a relaxed wrist. I used try to get more power/kick by focusing on waist torque but ended up with a sore back.

"That's all right. It helps to remember that English's preeminence as the ""world language"" didn't start until the 1800s and really hit its stride in the 20^th Century. Before that, England was just an unimportant island that happened to be off the coast of Europe. For centuries, the most important and respected languages in Western Europe were alternately French and Latin, especially in England in the context of the Norman Conquest of 1066 that replaced the Germanic English aristocracy with a new French one. If you could use a French or Latin word in conversation, you were clearly an important educated person. This pattern continues into a huge number of words where the French or Latin derived words are classier ((Germanic) kingly vs (French) royal vs (Latin) regal) or technical, especially in law (Fr lawyer, bailiff, jail, judge, court, and all manner of Latin, like *nolo contendere*) and church (cant, priest, nave)."

"&gt; A joule is a joule is a joule, but if we can't harvest that joule except inefficiently then it may be more useful to spend the energy doing something inefficient than simply not spending it.

I guess it depends on the rocket fuel. RP-1 can be burned in power plants, I imagine. It's just hydrocarbons after all. Another popular rocket fuel is hydrogen, which I believe is mostly produced from methane (that is natural gas). But either way hydrogen could be used in fuel cells to power vehicles, or even produce electricity if you absolutely insist.

It's important to remember that electricity is cheap on Earth, compared to the cost of getting into space. If you want to get your hydrogen for rocket fuel by electolysing water it's barely going to affect your budget.

Currently the cheapest way to get to LEO is SpaceX's Falcon9 rocket. It costs about $5000/kg. OTOH, the theoretical minimum energy required is 30MJ/kg, or about 9kWh. Which at current prices would cost you just over one dollar from the grid.

This makes it a little difficult to speculate about how rocket fuel would be used in a world where the scheme even remotely makes sense. For now people are perfectly fine with spending money, energy (including in form of electricity) to produce just the right kind of rocket fuel. Of course they're not going to turn around and burn it for a tiny return. If electricity was the scarce resource you could always save some by using less of it for creating and transporting rocket fuel."

"I frequently forget to clear the air bubbles.  If it's something canned in liquid I believe the danger is excessive head space, because the trapped air made the jar appear to be more full.

  In jams/jellies with air bubbles, I think the problem could be a bacteria bubble, but I have no source to refer for this.

I've opened and re-canned items in brine if the head space is too much (like in excess of 1/2""), because the brine didn't fully cover the vegetables/fruit after I inverted the jar to clear the bubbles.

Here's what the National Center for Home Food Preservation says:

&gt; Do I really need to leave a certain amount of headspace in the jar?
Yes, leaving the specified amount of headspace in a jar is important to assure a vacuum seal. If too little headspace is allowed the food may expand and bubble out when air is being forced out from under the lid during processing. The bubbling food may leave a deposit on the rim of the jar or the seal of the lid and prevent the jar from sealing properly. If too much headspace is allowed, the food at the top is likely to discolor. Also, the jar may not seal properly because there will not be enough processing time to drive all the air out of the jar.

"This feels a bit more like a spell with a planeswalker attached than a walker. I like the idea of having a ""plus"" effect based around something, but it seems like there is almost (fair) no situation in which you would play this card and then then use its 0 unless you were extremely far ahead and going for ult. And then the X amount of hasty counters would probly win you the game anways.

Seems like a card that may be broken in some combo deck, and strange (and possibly unfun) if you tried to play fair.

I'd try and give the +X (0) ability some sort of bonus and maybe make the card weaker overall if you wanted it around this power.

"For Gul'Dan, we can also think about where the events have lead to. When Sargeras was trapped in Medivh, he could only seem to communicate with his agents *through* Medivh. And even then, the Legion didn't seem to know Sargeras' plans to any full extent. I think it is possible that Sargeras (within Khadgar), knowing the Draenor invasion would fail, let Gul'Dan fail in order to get him pushed to our universes Tomb. Keep in mind that this is assuming that Khadgar is unaware of Sargeras being inside of him. Sargeras would not manifest his presence until the time was exactly right. And more than wanting to take over Dreanor (he's kind of already done so in the past) he truly covets taking Azeroth. 

So I guess what I'm saying is that it could all be a long-game play to push the fight into Azeroth, and to simultaneously resurrect himself. "

"Yes I countered your overly dramatic defense of being a glorified bus driver with logic and reason so therefore I must resent you. Tell yourself what ever you need to protect that ego of yours. The truth is men and women earn the rank of captain in the U.S. Military by performing their duties and defending our liberties. You just show up and ferry people from one place to another then act like you're hot shit because of it. You didn't earn or deserve the rank of captain. That's my issue.

They asked what job and rank you'd have on a starship with your personality, social and work skills. You figured you would be a starship captain because some corporate company gave you the unearned title of captain. I truthfully stated you're real world skills of being a pilot best translates to being a helmsmen and that's when your pathetic ego was hurt and you threw a hissy fit. I'm guessing that between the two of us your life is the one that's more empty and sad and that's why you covet your job and bullshit title so much.

"I'm not a cop but I do have a good one. Back in my paramedic days we were called to a situation unknown, a bar. When we got there there was a man laying on the floor with a bullet hole in his chest. My partner was about to hook up the EKG and I was ready to start an IV when somebody put a gun to my head. He looked over at my partner and said leave that bastard alone. For 10 long minutes we set watching this man laying on the floor dieing from his gunshot wound. When the man expired the person that held a gun to my head handed his pistol over to my partner and said thank you. He sat at the bar finished his beer and waited for the police. They subdued him without incident, took him away. My partner and I did a little research. Come to find out the man that he shot and killed had an affair with his wife. This man was so distraught about this situation that he gave up his entire life. He wanted that man dead. Needless to say this did a number on my partner and I. At the department we worked they offered us a three-week burnout with pay. Kind of like a vacation to get away from it all.  that was the longest three weeks of my life."

"At a glance, higher tempo and shorter passing don't mix, change that to lower tempo.

I would also get rid of play wider, the problem being that it also tells you defenders to play wide which opens up gaps for opposition teams to play through. Just take it off, and take off the exploit flanks and run at defence.

I would say that if a particular games needs these kind of instructions, include it then but not as tactical ground work. Plus, running at defence seems like it would clash with clash with shorter passing. 

I guess you are trying to playing a possession game, but your telling players to both move the ball around and dwell on the ball."

"&gt; It's almost like some people have children without having any idea of what children actually ARE

Very true. I used to work with a woman who was renting a house with her sister. Both were single mothers (co-worker had her child from a one-night stand. I don't know what the sister's story is). They had agreed that my co-worker's sister would not contribute any money toward rent/bills, but it was her job to watch the kids while my co-worker was at work.

They argued repeatedly because neither of them wanted to deal with the kids whenever my co-worker came home. Co-worker thought she deserved ""alone time"" after being at work all day. Her sister thought she deserved ""alone time"" after watching the kids all day.

As I wrote before, this is a risk you take when you decide to become a parent. ""Alone time"" and a cozy, 50/50, fair situation is not a guarantee."

"No, my friend. 'We' fans do not have rights. 

The producers of the show can do whatever they want, whenever they want. We are consuming a product. You cannot tell the producer how to creature their product - you simply buy that product or don't. Your choice. 

What you're saying here is your opinion on the show. Others may feel the latest season is the best so far. Point being, as of yet people saying the show is declining are the vocal minority. Once they become the majority, then sure the producers can -choose- to listen to you, but they are by no means obligated to. They can run their show into the ground if that's what they want.

Just because you feel the show is not going the way you like it does not mean everyone else should feel that way. Nothing is being taken away from you - because nothing was yours. You may have liked how it the show was, but now it's changed. Either continue watching or don't - but don't try to force a change on others.

Personally I think it won't happen for at least another 4-5 years, I think eventually everything would become so bad in all aspects, financial, social, cultural, etc... all because of government that people are going to lose confidence really quickly and the US dollar will tank, hyperinflation will wipe out all wealth and will turn the USA into a 3rd world country!"

After spending hours, eventually managed to boot with a recovery disk and then clean reinstalled Win 10. All good till I plug in the Netgear adapter and same problem comes up again. I unplug it and now Win 10 works fine again. So I think this adapter is causing problems with Win 10 we need to wait till Netgear officially offers new drivers."

The fetal brain does not develop enough to put out a characteristic human EEG pattern until 22-24 weeks'gestation. This is about the time *Roe v. Wade* restrictions on abortion start kicking in. Less than 2% of abortions happen this late, and those almost always because tests on the fetus reveal severe anomalies or dangers to the mother."

That thought is on my mind. Yesterday my in-law remarked on my apparent enthusiasm for farming and back to the land notions. He does not fully realize what my reasons are.

&gt; Do you really want to watch the riots, the rampant thievery as money/food becomes scarce?

Hopefully, not in person. I hope to be able to relocate while there is  still time. A friend of mine already sold out, and is moving to a remote location.

&gt; Can you work 50 hours a week, 60, 70, just to barely afford the necessities,and pay your bills?

50 hours a week is not so bad if you're working for yourself, and are highly self-reliant.

&gt; How hard can they work you till you're too fuck tired to keep going? 

How long can they work you, until you snap, and kill the bastards? 

&gt; Can you really watch everyone around you go through hell, and watch horrible things happen to everyone you love?

An excellent incentive to not let this happen to everyone you love.

&gt; How long can you watch the psychopathic oligarchs keep getting away with their atrocities till you're dead inside?

Just make them dead outside. Just a few percent who're mad enough and have the right skills can completely change the power situation.

&gt;  Will you still be anything resembling a person at the end of this?

Hardship is tolerable -- in fact, invigorating to some -- if you're doing something about it, and feel in control.

Your character has the ability to rewind time, which is cool because if there's a dialogue sequence you weren't happy with, you can ""rewind"" and try again, or you can learn information from someone, rewind to when they hadn't told you, and use the information against them.

The story is written and voiced well and deals with a lot of mature themes, although there's a few lip-syncing issues. Most of the complaints are targeted at how cringe-worthy the dialogue is, since the writers attempt to mimic modern teenagers. I don't find it to be a big deal, to be honest. The ones who let that get in the way of the story already made their mind up before they played it."

"Actually the election of Abraham Lincoln was also a contributing factor as it was viewed as a loss of representation and he didn't have any input on slavery at the point and in fact it was noted that he really had no position on it to start with. Also the North put quite a few restrictions on the south to maintain a political upper hand and the issue of slavery was just one of a few way to keep it. Like I said, it wasn't just slavery that made the south secede, but it was a part of it. And the original point of my whole argument is that the flag isn't seen as a symbol of slavery but more that one should be able fight to have a foothold amongst peers and as a symbol of regional pride.

 Both the people in the original post, the flag ripper and the gun puller are both Jackasses. The flag ripper is a jackass because he is through ignorance insulting a point of pride to many people for the reasons that I stated and the gun puller is even more of a jackass through self-explanatory reasons. I just wanted to say that there is more at play than ""hurr durr muh slavery"" that the original comment stated. Can we agree on that?"
"&gt;Do you know if it is possible to split a co2 tank in between 2 tanks with a 8 foot airline tube? 

Yup, you can get something like [this](http://www.co2art.co.uk/collections/splitters-manifolds-valves/products/aquarium-2-way-brass-co2-splitter-for-solenoid-and-regulator) which means you can supply two tanks with one co2 tank. Each side has it's own needle valve too so you can control the CO2 flow to each tank individually. 

Not the previous person, but for stock I'd make sure you check the stocking guide on aquadvisor. How big is your tank? A shoal of celestial pearl danios might be nice if its a small tank. 

I think you can always keep trimming reineckii to keep it small. I'm not sure though. I don't know how it would look, but you could have larger plant clusters in the back two corners, and plant lightly (perhaps vallis or something) in the back centre so you can still see the outline of the rocks?"

MAFIA stands for Morte Alla Francia Italia Anelia! (Italian for 'Death To the French Is Italy’s Cry') the Mafia started in Sicily and it was organized by the church.

"&gt; I don't think the argument that God does not exist because evil exists is very solid.

The problem of evil doesn't say that evil exists, therefor God doesn't. It says that evil exists, therefor an omnimax (all loving all knowing all powerful) God doesn't exist. If a God exists, it either doesn't know about evil, isn't powerful enough to prevent evil, or doesn't want to prevent evil."

 In fact NASA had a couple more Saturn V rockets bought and paid for and ready to go to the moon but further missions were cancelled because the budget was too small by 1972.

"What's Rainbow Energy's purpose in the deck? I assume you want it to attack with Malamar, but why is there a mega Sceptile and Rayquaza, then? Who's your primary attacker? Is it necessary to have both Malamar AND Sceptile, as well as grass energies for a Pokemon with a 1-1 line in the deck? What's the strategy/synergy? As for the Unknown, what are they for? Their usefulness for draw power is certain, but they work best in decks like Vespiquen that benefit from more Pokemon in the discard pile, right? So why not replace them with some trainers and an extra Shaymin or two for better draw power?

Also, just realized this, but without Sky field, the whole Rayquaza part of the deck kinda falls apart? My main suggestion would be to ask yourself ""what's unnecessary here?"" and cut out stuff accordingly. Then, it'd probably be easier to get something more consistent. It's not the worst list in existence obviously; with more focus, it can probably amount to something more playable and enjoyable. I hope that's decent feedback!"

"My employer has a retention program where they pay $10K/year of loans for up to 6 years, and my loan balance is only a little over $18K. After the first (after-tax) payment is applied today, it will be a little over $12K. Since the max benefit for this employer program far exceeds my current balance and this large payment pushes my payment due date forward a few years, I'm trying to figure out whether I can stop making payments myself and let everything ride until my employer makes the next lump-sum payment next August, and keep doing this until they're paid off. I think this means I would be paid in full in 2018, without having to make any more payments myself.

Does this plan make sense? I see the following potential drawbacks:

* If the program is cancelled before 2018, or if my application to the program is denied (we have to reapply every year, but they have approved everyone in the few years this program has existed), I'll have a large amount of accrued interest waiting for me.

* I'd have to unenroll from automatic payments, which would kick my interest rate up from 4.55% to 4.8%. I don't think this would make a difference in the payoff date.

* If interest capitalizes at the end of each month on Stafford loans that aren't in deferment/forbearance even though no payment is due (does it?), it might push the payoff date to 2019.

I'm not really concerned about the interest-related drawbacks assuming my employer would be paying it anyway, and my job is pretty secure. I finished grad school in 2009 with over $200K in student loans, which I've managed to get this low over the past 6 years, and I just find the idea of being done with ""my"" part of paying them off as of today to be really, *really* tempting. Can I do it?

This could be overhauled much like the system in Skyrim, where your reputation with different groups is tracked independently and not tied to a karma system.

"Dana over at House Tweaking has a great post about doing partial cloth diapering - disposables when out of the house (or if there are other times where it makes more sense, like while traveling) and cloth while at home.  Therefore reducing waste and saving money but not dealing with all of the hassle that comes with cloth diapering 100% of the time.

I'm planning to cloth diaper a good chunk of the time, largely to save money and because our trash barrel is limited to once weekly pickup and would fill up fast if only using disposables.  But we'll use disposables for the newborn transitional period (to avoid paying for separate newborn sizing) and when out and about to save on the hassle of carting around used diapers.  Plus my husband is super freaked out by the idea of cloth diapering so I'm hoping to ease him into it - one way or another, he WILL have to deal with lots of baby poop.  Might as well save money while doing it.

On the money front... I'm planning to do prefolds and covers because they seem to be cheaper, and my washing machine will cope with them better (I have a front-loading all in one washer/dryer, so need to do less bulky loads at a time)."

Now, the 718 Euro includes that BENQ screen which costed around 125 euro. But it seems for now i don't need any upgrade at all the coming 1 or 2 years. It's plays this game with 60fps constantly with every now and then going down to 40 when autosaving or before i 'level' up but then back to 60 (which is the max fps in this game, from what i read) on max settings and the highest resolution.

"Most of our students don't have an interest in working at a studio as engineers. We are more artist-based and artist focused. What I would suggest is to make sure this is what you want to do, because it's very different than being an artist/producer. A lot of young artists get fooled thinking because it's in the studio, it's closer to their goals. But working on other people's music is a completely different perspective than creating your own. However, if you do want to go to a studio, the main thing they are looking for is hunger. You have to be willing to do anything at any time. Hunger will always progress your status in the pack. 
It's been awesome to see Jauz' rise and how quick it's happened, along with all the students out there following their dreams. The best part is how, regardless of his quick rise, Jauz is still at the studios fairly often, working hard and intermingling with the collective. I'm proud to see any of our members attain their goals. "

"One problem you might be facing is the ""support rule"" in the matchmaking: If one team has a support, the other one will have a support as well. That is a big issue for Tyrande and Tassadar since they are both a bit (or a bit more) weak on the healing side and healing is stronger than other support-y stuff. So if you're solo-supporting as Tyrande against a Malfurion, he'll simply negate all of your team's damage while their team's damage is pretty much permanent since you cannot keep up with the healing.

To mitigate this problem you have two options from which one is pretty great and the other one an excuse of a workaround... First, try queueing with a ""real"" healer. This leaves you open for the utility support role. Uther seems to be a great pick since you both have good burst heal and supplement each other with just more healing. I've also successfully run a Tyrande/Malfurion combo because Tyrande can make up for the lack of burst healing (at least a bit) and Malf just delivers the raw healing power of his heals over time. With this setup you are able to excel at zoning, stunning, making vulnerable and adding dps while your team still does not lack healing power.

The workaround is to take healing talents and try to be a healer. It'll not be perfect by far, but you can out-heal Uther's Q after lvl13. He'll still have his W and R in addition to that and out-heal you in total, but you can at least make your team compete: With overflowing light she does very similar healing (just about 25 HP less healing at lvl20) on an 8 sec cooldown compared to Uther's Q at 12 sec for half (or even a third if you took celestial attunement) of the mana-cost. Additionally she can take battle momentum, lowering her cooldowns so that she can spam her Q like nobody's business (if she was constantly attacking the cooldown would be around 5 sec). It'll most certainly not make you the best healer in the world, but your team might have a fighting chance - and all only a the cost of 2-3 talent choices, leaving the other tiers for boosting that utility you bring to the table."

"Honesty, when LoTR was made Peter Jackson hated the idea of a traditional wizard magic fight. He's said so openly in behind the scenes interviews. And, during it's theatrical releases, the LoTR trilogy was almost directly competiting with Harry Potter at the time. So he used that type of imagery as little as possible. 

For example, he really wanted the Saruman vs Gandalf fight to be more like two old men beating the shit out of eachother, instead of a flashy wizards' duel.

"IPS is much better as far as image quality, colors, and contrast, but the method to change colors (In-Plane-Swtiching aka IPS) is very slow in comparison to a ""quality"" tn/film.  But that is nothing new.  Historically there has always been a speed vs colors limitation going on, and something has to suffer for the other to be great.  


However, IPS panels can run at 120hz and beyond these days.  ASUS just released an amazing freesync 27"" IPS that will do 144hz, however, with freesync on, it is limited to 90.  So although it is partially crippled, it is great to see 144hz IPS finally on the market.  The total switching time is still double (4ms vs 2ms g2g) but in a real world gaming situation I doubt that would be noticeable.  There are also korean panels that have been on the market for quite some time that can do 120hz with their IPS panels.


For me personally, I used to totally ignore any TN/film monitor with shitty 6-bit color depth and cling on to my 60hz IPS for years.  But that changed when I got the asus VG248QE.  The color is almost just as good if I really convince myself, but the speed of the panel more than makes up for it. "

IMHO, man can find a sense of community and purpose in the service of others while working in a market that is still held by private interests.

Then again, sociology isn't an objective science and is rather subjective.  Add to that the whole human factor affects all the variables.  Since we aren't robots we cannot truely measure which system is the best.  So I can see how you think capitalists are so evil, but on the other hand the largest genocides in history have been at the hands of your communist breathern.

I won't ever claim that capitalism is perfect, but trying to blame so many of societies problems on it is ridiculous.

"/u/billbillbilly nails it pretty well.

The modern atomic theory didn't exist until the early 19th century, and things like conservation of mass, etc until the 18th century.

So forget the periodic table. ""elements"" were the four elements that all matter was made of: earth, air, fire, and water, going back to aristotle, except add a millenia of arabic commentators adding to the theory.

Like billbillbilly also mentioned, metal in 1500 was thought to be made up of mercury and sulphur. Salt minerals being needed to change the ratio. By changing the ration you change the metal.

Metals were thought to ""ripen"" in nature. This is based off of empirical evidence: there are traces of silver in copper ore, and traces of gold in silver ore, etc.

And so alchemists thought this process from lesser metals to precious metals can be done artificially. That's alchemy.

Basically you can break things down to their ""elements"" (base earth, air, fire, water) and then build them back up carefully into what you want (gold). 

Alchemical recipes also have aspects of cabbalah, hermeticism, sympathetic magic, astrology, and all other sorts of mystyical aspects. See [the History of Alchemy Podcast](http://historyofalchemy.com) for a lot more.

Feel free to ask follow up questions if you want more details. You might also be interested in some of the [other alchemy questions I've answered](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/profiles/bemonk)

The periodic table itself is also interesting.. but not direct to your question. In the 18th century chymists started noticing that some matter really can't be brocken down, not matter what. The new ""atom"" (the old ""atom"" was from Democritus and was really just theoretical)... at some point they noticed that these new elements had characteristics and things in common with each other. In fact three elements often had things in common with each other. These trifecta were some of the first patterns noticed that lead to the periodic table."

"&gt;I stopped thinking of myself as a ""gamer"" after the Mass Effect 3 fiasco. While many people had legitimate criticisms of the game, many of which I agreed with, the hivemind behavior of the ""fans"" was utterly despicable, culminating in a charity being hijacked to ""prove a point,"" then demanding their money back from the charity. It was fucking disgusting. 

This is how I feel about the current Fire Emblem: Fates gay controversy. While Fates' story has some regressive elements (gay conversion, shameless fanservice, etc.), it's hard to see which of these complaints are legitimate and which are just knee-jerk reactions from fans that already wanted to hate the game. There's way too much ""DURR FE IS BECOMING TOO CASUAL"", ""DURR I KNEW THIS GAME WOULD SUCK"", etc. I even had to stop reading Ghazi because they'd link to whiny Tumblr blogs/annoying YouTube vids about the incident. The funny thing is, the series literally would have died with Awakening if Intelligent Systems hadn't changed things, but I suppose that's better than letting their precious Nintendo series fall victim to those filthy casuals.

WE only have steam, GOG, and Desura, but Desrua's company is bankrupt and they don't have cards like Steam does that you can pick up at retail stores. What I don't do online banking, alot of gamers I know are that way. If desura had cards and good games they might have stook around. The emulation sceen on linux is poor compared to windows. While we do have the most common emulators for populer systems, Windows has emulators for EVERYTHING! For example does Linux have a CD-i emulator, no so you can't play the Shitty triforce game or hotel mario on your pc, with out wine. I don't use wine for emulation. Also most of the extraction tools are windows only. I don't know of any tools that can rip a GBA cart on Linux. Most of the CD/DVD consoles don't even have drivers for Linux, but they do for Windows. Some of them need comercial software, or speical dev hardware that does not work with linux. For example the GD aka Gigabite Disk. Netbsd has a driver, but Linux does not."

"Well considering we brought 600+ people from New York, no, it's not a regular thing we do at Coors field.  We usually are at Citi and are going to a few other ballparks every year.  We've been to Chicago, Baltimore, Florida, California, Philadelphia, The Bronx, and a few others I can't remember.  So you're saying that despite the fact that we travel with the team even when they're not doing well, specifically going to Coors when the Mets were doing well makes us bandwagons.  Jeez, Darren must be psychic, because he organized this with the Rockies before the season even started.  We have a lot of original chants and songs, and some we use from our members who are MLS or college football fans.  The roll call, we've done that once or twice, usually at Yankee Stadium to annoy the fans there, but occasionally other places.  I don't like it very much but I'm not in charge.  So what makes us bandwagon fans again?  The fact that we went to Coors field when in first place?  Your logic is as shaky as your bullpen.

"As others have mentioned, you should be fine running NginX or HAProxy (or others) on the same server/droplet as your application runs on.  Another option would be to use Docker and dockerify your application separately from your web server.  On the small scale this may be overkill, but it's really easy enough once you get used to it.

On a single server, you can also consider something like dokku/dokku-alt, which uses docker in your own server with some extras to act similar to heroku for deploying your own applications."

8.  Blush/Bronzer (Anything from NYX is awesome)
9.  Setting powder for Face (Revlon Nearly Naked Pressed Powder is a gooooooood one)
10.  Eyeshadow palette (Morphe Brushes wins again.  They offer a WONDERFUL yet inexpensive selection of palettes to choose from.  Most are under $25.)
11.  Eyeliner (Eyeko Skinny Liquid Eyeliner, NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil)

"Patriarchy is the idea that males are the ones that control society and that all things related to men are considered superior, and from that construct stems a lot of societal issues. It's the idea men are inherently more privileged. I don't believe this really construct exists in a lot of more ""developed"" countries.

General gender stereotypes are just concepts that we have to categorize men and women. People often feel a need to conform to stereotypes. There is no assumption about men being more powerful or more privileged.

Some of those stereotypes are bad for the gender they describe. Here, the idea that all men want sex all the time under any circumstance is a bad stereotype that often ends in male rape being marginalized.  Feminists do sometimes talk about gender stereotypes that are harmful to their respective gender (like, I see feminists talk a decent amount about marginalizing of male rape), but it doesn't have anything to do with patriarchy, really. They aren't even similar constructs.

Does that clear it up for you or is something still murky? I know this stuff can be a bit hard to understand sometimes."

"&gt; Campbell uses correlation to make his conclusions but doesn't test them.

Right. He can't exactly do that without an equally long survey of willing participants for the test. I don't know how that is possible -- not that that makes his hypotheses valid. The main empirical results that he goes with are what other doctors have done, notably Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn's dietary interventions for heart disease reversal. It doesn't cover the cancer claims, but it does do a pretty good job of addressing the heart disease part of the hypothesis, and it looks solid to me.

The wheat thing is an interesting point I've seen other critics of The China Study bring up as well. I don't know anything about it.

&gt; He started off assuming something is true and only talked about data that supported his conclusion. Win win I guess.

Exactly the same problem as with CAGW advocates.

&gt; Here's why I got out of nutrition, Dietetics specifically. the academy of nutrition and dietetics is bought and paid for by food companies.

A large part of The China Study is very much about exactly that problem. If what he says is true, that part of the book was shocking to me, in addition to your statement, and we definitely need to find a way to get commercial interests out of government nutrition recommendations, and the fuck out of education. (This same problem is happening with CAGW, by the way.) He talks at great length about how our nutrition education materials from kindergarten through medical school are funded and presented by milk producers and massive food conglomerates, and educators eat it up like candy. Medical doctors receive hardly any training on nutrition at all, and what they do receive is presented by companies like Kraft and Dannon. Exactly what you are talking about.

&gt; My professor loved the presentation.

Which is incredibly weird, considering as I just described, Campbell directly addresses this problem at great length in the book. Indeed, I would say that is his core driving principle."

Most suggested is counteracting the color with green (I think it's green) makeup and putting cover up over that.  Also there is dermablend, which is supposed to also hide a beard well (you'll find videos for it too) but it's expensive.

I would guess that once the ball gets rolling on a ZA, things go to shit very quickly, so a week before the coma at most because when Rick gets shot, it's just business as usual in his town -- not the getting shot part, just the way people are living, etc. Even if the outbreak was only say, on the West Coast at that time, Rick, as law enforcement, would have come out of the coma at least suspecting that the same thing was happening in his home town, but he has no inkling, and has to be filled in on what's happened by others."

"**Link:** Notorious for his Spam/Camp reputation, Link has powerful attacks with early kill-options and a decent recovery. He has no real shield-pressure options, and his grab is lack-luster, so shields can be rough on him.

Nothing big for characters with good grab combos, but still, nothing to sneeze at!"
"Depends on whether your roll with more Support characters or Combat characters, how many casters you usually use and how tough it has been for you to clear the EX ++ content.

Thundaja is the popular choice, but you already have it at R2.  The 4* abilities are nice, but they are a total waste of a slot at R1, since the battles where Power Breakdown makes any ounce of difference from Power Break are long enough that just 2 charges isn't enough, you need 4-6 charges, so you'd have to supplement with another character using Power Break.  If another character has to bring Power Break, bringing Power Breakdown is already redundant and a waste of a slot.  Getting Power Breakdown to R2 would make it a viable slot option.

Speaking from personal experience, having one Support character with Magic Breakdown R2 and Power Breakdown R2 helped me overcome a huge hurdle in difficulty for the recent challenges.  Mitigation-wise, it generally only gains me one extra medal, but it pushed me over the threshold from finishing bosses with an Expert rating to clearing Champion by a hair.  I run most fights with a single caster, single healer, and the rest are either melee or ranged combat.  My main caster is lvl 65 Vivi and with his Focus Magic skill and Devotion RM he usually hits the damage cap with just Thundaga.  Thundaja only really gives me an edge over Thundaga if the target isn't weak to Lightning, if it's too early for me to pop Focus Magic or if I give it to a backup caster with a weaker MAG rating.

My personal choice would probably be to bump Power Breakdown up to R2 (just to be able to actually justify taking it to battles) but then save the rest of the orbs for getting Thundaja to R3.  If Power Breakdown is sitting at R1 in your inventory, you're probably never going to be able to justify actually using it, since I never actually saw any benefit from the Breakdown abilities until I got them from R1 to R2."

"I'd been with this girl for 8 years. I moved to a different state with her, and paid for the apartment we moved into, roughly 5k after first and last month, and the deposit. I furnished the place too. I was working everyday for a year in the next town over, which was an hour drive each direction.

She made a group of friends through her grad program (all guys) who she would bring around, and drink with.

She was dating one of the guys  while I was working. I started a grad program, and stopped working in august after a year of living up there with her. She broke up with me in October, after I'd moved all our stuff into a new apartment by myself, because she was physically weak.

My husband got NO CHANCE.

We had been together for a year when I graduated from college and were working towards getting married (he was a year behind me in undergrad).  I *tried* to introduce them to my parents at my graduation, and wanted to bring him home for my graduation party.

They refused to speak to him when they visited *college town*. I insisted he come with us to my post-graduation dinner in college town and they were FURIOUS with me for that. Then they refused to take my ""Fuck Toy"" home to meet grandma. He remained my ""fuck toy"" until we got engaged.... which was, eight months after I graduated.

Then there were hysterics.

Then they realized they'd never met him, claimed I'd ""hidden him"" from them, and they invited the both of us down to visit them.

At which point they were sickly sweet and put on a great Narcissist ""Public Face"".  They really needed to do that because we were almost ready to cut them off. We should have, I swear.

He moved closer to them, and held his hand out to the man he now knew to be of House Tarth.

""Glad to meet a fellow Stormlander. I am Durran Estermont, Lord of Greenstone. This is my brother, Steffon."" He beckoned to the man beside him.

"It didn't get cancelled in Sweden so obviously it was more popular here.  

To be honest, Swedish TV stations usually don't cancel already produced domestic TV series. They usually just change running time to a worse one and eventually dump it on some obscure low profile channel within the station if ratings continue to be low. Then most people *think* it was cancelled.  

Considering life in Sweden as portrayed in the TV show: No, that's how a middle class Stockholm city life is as seen by a liberal middle class New England American who's lived a middle class Stockholm city life for the past 10 years or so. Thus, very specific and can't be generalized to the 97% rest of Sweden. I grew up in a working class home outside a small city in northern Sweden and that life has not much in common by the kind of life the characters live in the TV show. Compare the life of the characters in *Sex and the City* with how someone in a small town in Iowa lives; or in any small town or even suburb of a big city for that matter."

i lived across the hall in college from a girl that was incredibly attractive. perfect body and beautiful face. she and i were hanging out a lot. i was kind of her handy-man for the dilapidated building we lived in. she came over and asked me to fix the outlet in her bathroom because she needed to take a shower and dry her hair so she could go out that night. so I'm fixing her outlet by replacing it with the one from her unused bathroom and i'll grab a new one later when I'm near a Home Depot. she comes out of the shower in her towel to go to her closet and change. she comes back out of the closet in what i can now identify as 'purposefully sexy underwear'. she asks my opinion on her bra. i tell her it looks good, and in my mind i'm thinking ""oh wow, I'm in her way while she's trying to get ready to go. i should hurry up because she must be running late"".

"&gt; Why would having the task keep the task ids cause problems when tasks are deleted, and what does ""moving"" a task entail? 

Causing problems is probably the wrong word. If deleting a subtask operates against the subtask and the subtask holds the relationship to the parent, then to delete the subtask I would be modifying that subtask, it's subtasks, and it's sibling classes (if we keep ordering). If the parent controls the relationship, then I modify the subtask and the parent, but don't really need to modify the siblings.  

Moving a task could be reparenting the task, or changing the ordering.

&gt; Cleaning up the orphaned record is more garbage collection than anything else. 
&gt; You do have to worry about data integrity more than you would in a normalized relational database, but that's the sacrifice you have to make for better scalability (not that most people using the non-relational databases actually need that, they're just using it because they heard NoSQL is cool these days).

I guess what I'm asking is is this the standard way of doing it for these types of systems? Is the standard to have the parent control the relationships and perform the additional cleanup and manual integrity checks (obviously some of those also exist in the relational models as well)? 

What about in the example of a simple Category that's just a label? Is it more common to store the label itself, or a link back to a common instance?

&gt; you've posted feminism being a religion to badsocialscience

I'll admit, that post was a bit of a stretch. It wouldn't be allowed under the current, stricter posting guidelines of /r/badsocialscience. That said, the badsocialscience in that post comes not just from the poor understanding of feminism, but also from the poor understanding of what makes something a religion.

&gt; and you even posted this.

I fully stand by that post. I do think there is a common prejudice where heterosexuality is desired, where children are encouraged in subtle and not-so-subtle ways to be straight, yet non-normative sexualities are seen as merely something to be tolerated. Also, you'll probably not really understand the point I was making with that post if you don't read the Sedgwick article I linked at the beginning of it."
"Their logic of not hiring people who score too high is:

&gt;But New London police interviewed only candidates who scored 20 to 27, on the theory that those who scored too high could get bored with police work and leave soon after undergoing costly training.

This is one department in one city in one state in the country.  Some place like the NYPD or LAPD would never bother doing this because there is huge room for promotion and endless opportunities, they want the best and brightest.

In New London, a town of 27,000 people, there is zero room to grow.  The police chief is elected so you can't even work towards that.  Seems pretty straight forward to me."

Reread OP's question
Why exactly does it suck? He got a higher combo so he has a better score
"The funny thing about this is, the way the game is played in the NHL now, they could take icing out of the game and it would encourage scoring. Because it has turned into a puck possession game, teams would welcome the opportunity to gain the zone in a breakout rather than give their opponent a 50/50 chance to clear the zone by winning a faceoff."

Remember, he puts runes on his leather duster and it can hold.  Circles can be made out of salt and Walmart candles, though metal is better.  I feel like things like origin of materials are not *as* mystical as one might imagine in most fantasy worlds and therefore Harry, who notes that his wizarding supplies are indeed expensive and lives off of ramen and pizza, could totally find a hockey stick that would hold the runes and use it!  Certainly makes walking around the city draw less attention."

I've also reread the passage describing the vault. You are correct that the artwork is focuses on divinity. But the vault itself is Greek in design.

"Quick stat dump from NRMP:
According to the data from this year's match, 62% of positions were filled by a U.S. Allo Senior. About 5% of seniors failed to match, and (probably the most important statistic for our purposes), there are about 1.5 PGY-1 positions per senior. This is above the average of 1.4 positions per senior from 1976-2015. So yeah, you might not match neurosurg or whatever, but there are more than enough positions currently for you to get a residency, somewhere.

The strongest I've ever seen a class illegitimately (bugs, etc.) was when Titan's Grip was first introduced to warriors. It didn't remove your weapons when you respeced. Warriors would spec into TG, put on two big-ass weapons, then respec to fury.

"Think of baptism as giving you a ticket into Heaven. If you sin (possibly quantifying that with ""too badly"" or ""too much""), you lose that ticket. But God is willing to forgive our sins. And while our opinions on what that forgiveness looks like differ, the point stands that you can regain that ticket. So if someone unfortunately dies before the age of reason, that can't have sinned, and will probably go to Heaven.

As for the penitent thief, Catholicism recognizes three types of Baptism, and the concept shouldn't be objectionable to other branches of Christianity. The one everyone knows and debates is Baptism by water. That's the normal way. But if you were never baptized and died a martyr, we'll say that counts. (As an example, say ISIS killed a non-Christian for defending Christianity, which, unfortunately, has probably happened) The other way is Baptism of desire. If you were planning of being baptized, but died before you got a chance, God won't screw you over for it. And finally, the special case: the Penitent Thief. I'm sure you could argue him into one of those three categories. But there's a much simpler explanation. Jesus is sorta God..."

"Knizia is at his best when there are tiles being laid down. 

I absolutely love this as a 2-player game.  With 3 or 4 players, it can get really unbalanced, as who you choose to compete with on statues can leave another player winning with a very strong position and not much you can do about it.  If two people gang up on you, taking turns in stealing statues from you, it doesn't matter how good your strategy is, you aren't going to win.  


I think most multiplayer games suffer from this problem.  The reason I love a game like Dominion is because it's impossible for multiple players to gang up on someone.  So the player with the best strategy normally still wins.  

Anyway, 2-player Samurai rocks.  Absolutely love it. "

"You don't have to be at your job for a year before you get pregnant, it's a year before you need to take your leave... so give it at least 3-5 months at a new job before you get pregnant and you should be ok.  Also, don't be too concerned about birth control - I was on the pill for almost 15 years before I stopped.  I was pregnant in 4 months.  It's faster for some people, slower for others, but how long you're on the pill doesn't seem to make a huge difference.  And I'm sure you've got your reasons for wanting to start a family before you hit 30, but as a mom who has friends with kids going off to college and friends with brand new infants, starting a family in your late 30s isn't too bad either.  :)

As for 6k in student loan debt ... that's -nothing-.  I know people with tens of thousands in student loan debt that got mortgages.  It's all about your credit rating and your debt to income ratio.  If you don't have a couple credit cards between you and your husband, get a couple, and pay them off in full every month.  It does wonders for your credit rating, and it doesn't matter how high the interest rate is, because you don't leave anything on the card to cause interest to accrue.

My profession isn't a money maker, but I earn more than grocery money.  We're in the Boston metro area and daycare here is Expensive - like almost the cost of UMass annual tuition expensive.  I love my son to pieces, and it hurts to have someone else effectively raising him 5 days a week, but I also know I'd go nuts stuck at home caring for him, and I know he gets amazing care and loads of fun activities at daycare I wouldn't ever do with him at home.  Once kid #2 comes, the choice gets much harder.  Work is an hour drive away, which means I'll have to split those couple hours I get in the evening even thinner to spend time with both my babies.  I hate job hunting, and to be honest, I'm not sure I'd find something else closer to home.  I can't imagine being a full time stay at home mom, but I'm worried working full time at my current job is going to kill me.  The drawback is, if I quit, I lose X years of earning potential, experience, knowledge and end up back at the bottom of the totem pole...  So yeah, there's never a good time.  :)"

I once ordered food at a Chinese pkace, and the server asked me about my acne, and I just shook my head at her, and then she went in the back and tried to hand me a bottle of something and I said ""we're leaving"" and cried all the way to the car. I have cystic acne and if I'm not diligent it flares up pretty bad. I've got it under control, but have scarring now, and people still make comments...I leafned to shut them down pretty quick, though. "

"My first mtb was a Trek 4300, $540.   I put $200 into that bike (better brake pads, better seat, better tires).   That's a good start.  
Trek now offers a 4900 with disc brakes for around $600 I think.  If I were you I'd go with 29"" wheels and be open minded about purchasing a proper set of tires because entry level bikes are notorious for offering crap tires.  Mountain Bike Action is one of the bigger publications and you could order their buying guide online (it is published in spring so I doubt it would still be on the shelf).  There are some very good bikes to be had in the $1800 range like the Trek Stache 5 which is built with some of the latest technology in the industry like oversized tires, rear derailleur only for simplicity in shifting, rigid fork (lower mntc costs) and one of the funnest  geometry's one a bike.   I bought my son a Trek Stache 7 for $2000 in 2013 and it is a very capable bike allowing him to progress his skill-set to a much higher level than a $600 bike would allow.  Just do a ton of research and do yourself a favor by parking lot testing a Stache.  And the most important thing is to buy the right size and wear a helmet on every single ride (Bell Stoker is $65).  Good luck, mtb is awesome."
"Yeah, I hear you. On one hand, I love the feeling of creating an unorthodox set and pulling off a stupid kill with an underpowered pokémon, but on the other hand I wish that it wasn't so rare. 

Oh well, that's what pretty much all high level competition is though. Someone works out a new, effective strategy and people adopt it until it becomes commonplace so new strategies emerge. I bet that VGC finalists in a couple of years will have an incredibly different team setup to this, regardless of whether new pokémon are released."

To give an example, I've never had a guy compliment me on any specifics with my makeup, unless it was something really obvious like bright purple lipstick. And even still he'll just say ""Nice lips!"" With my girlfriends, they'll tell me my winged eyeliner is super on point, because it's something they'll notice and also because they know it's something that's difficult. Or they'll compliment how my eyeshadow is blended. Or how mu foundation matches my skintone. Stuff like that."

"Let me ask you, where in the south are you thinking of heading to?  I am in Tx, and right now, due to the slowdown/halt in the oil industry, jobs are a little more scarce than they were 2 years ago.  The people that used to work that industry are now filling other jobs that used to be available...  so there are slim pickings here, for people that were thinking about doing that sort of work.

But if you have urban skills, then you can probably still get a job in urban areas, since most of the mis-placed oil field hands don't have the skills to fill those kinds of jobs."

"Small engines in very small light cars but if you go weight for weight or horsepower for horsepower you see big differences until fairly recently.

"Old vehicles are not safe. New ones are miracles of safety engineering. Jesus, if you crashed in a car pre 1980 at anything faster than 30 MPH you'd be having a rough time.

"You say ""we"", but neither I nor any of my friends have called for people like Edward Snowden and other whistle-blowers to be imprisoned.

I think if you ask average people, they'll probably have a lot of varied answers. ""We"" haven't turned on the enlightenment. I, for one, wholeheartedly believe in free expression, for better or worse, and I suspect that many individuals broadly agree with that, however I can see how many people prize financial and personal security over an ideal that seems unrealizable. This is exacerbated when our institutions and leadership selectively apply or restrict enlightenment ideals when it suits their interests.

So to answer your very broad assertion: I disagree, but emphasize that free expression always must be defended from those whose interests aren't served by such an ideal."

"&gt;Both Trump and Sanders took shots at the media at their rallies this week, but Trump’s candidacy is fueled by free media exposure, and the press receives pride of place at his events. In Alabama, seating reserved for the press was front and center, at about the 20-yard line.

&gt;In Reno, reporters were shunted off to the side.

&gt;In Alabama, bottles of free water were reserved for the press, while the hoi polloi had to shell out $3.

&gt;In Reno, water was free for everybody, but not easily accessible from where reporters sat.

Trump owes everything to the media and once ""the magic's gone"" he will disappear. Bernie owes everything to hard work and activism and that's why he'll prevail in the end."

There are so many unanswered questions and to have him be possessed and essentially be a totally different character would absolutely stop his plot dead in its tracks.

Ok I'm joking now, you sounded a little hung up on the word crazy.  Of course to each his own.  However, I have been a big fan of cgi all my life but there is a lot of bad cgi and sometimes it can take you out of the scene.  I remember clearly when seeing the new trilogy thinking wow, that cgi yoda is pretty bad.  I was surprised thinking of the budget and that's the best they could do?  Especially because they knew if people didn't believe in yoda in ESB, a big chunk of the movie would fall apart.  But they delivered back then.

Actually they did use a puppet for portions of ep1 and it was really bad.  They've re-done cgi for the bluray, which isn't that great either.  But in this example the puppet is really bad, way worse than esb.

"Yeah, I don't doubt that he's worse than Kirk in the scheme right now. If we start RG3, I think it's quite possible that we'll win fewer games than if we start Kirk Cousins.

But I think there's a slight chance that RG3 learns how to play NFL quarterback and winds up being a better player than a guy like Cousins could ever be. He came in having never played NFL football, successfully played college ball in the NFL in 2012, got massacred (the obvious penalty for being playing college football in the pros) and has struggled ever since, with injuries, with scheme changes, etc. 

Normally, I'd advocate pulling the plug on a situation like that. Let's call the experiment complete, conclude that RG3 can't be taught to play NFL football, and move on. But I don't see a lot of upside there; we know what Cousins can do, and we're rebuilding anyway. My point is simply that if we're screwed anyway, we might as well drag out the RG3 experiment another year."

Jang has inflated his importance but smart enough not to lie. Despite Jang pumping out article after article about the OGD, they met a fate worse than debunking and have largely been ignored. 

Also in addition Jang is hardly the highest ranking defector. That would be Kyong Won-ha or Hwang Jang-yop depending on how defined highest ranking. "

"Hey, since no one's answered you yet, I thought I would, although I don't have much advice. This is one of those universal questions that to the best of my knowledge no one has yet solved :)

Your best bet here is to work around the cat. Can you set up your keyboard in a retractable shelf or otherwise position it where your cat can't lie on it? Cover it with something except for when you need to type?"

"I agree. "
"Flames "
Lol...so sad that some people think that is all Jim Crow was about. Water fountains were the LEAST of their worries under that system.

Same here. Is she like a Denver Snuffer?
I'd love to see what this looks like when worn. :)
"Every time I play blackjack, I speculate that the dealer's hiding a 10 when I'm deciding whether to hit on 16. Just got to avoid those gamblin' fools that don't get ""the book,"" screwing with the card flow."

"A fetus will become a human, if no action is taken to end it's life. Sperm cells are clearly not human, nor will it become one unless it met with an egg. Morning after pills prevents the sperm from meeting with an egg."
"Creates a barrier in the frontline. Enemy attacks within the barrier are reduced by (25/35/50)%. Each affected enemy will heal all allies by 45% of their attack damage up to 3 times.  
The 50% reduction stacks with Anut to completely nullify damage. I've done this in Ascended WB to guarantee a win almost all the time.

"[Baroness - Blue Record](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuFYVtV7d8)

I've listened to it about twelve times this week.  It's a fucking massive mountain of an album.  Right up there with Yes, Mastodon and The Mars Volta as far as prog goes.  It's incredibly soulful to boot.  AND they're from my city, so I've got a shit ton of respect for them making it out of the swamp."
Holy shit thank you
"I think your right.  vm-735 is a moref and it will not be the same in the new vcenter.

Platypus! They're so awesomely weird. If I had to choose between cats and dogs I'll go with cats.
My only fear is the legendary Mithy-Tilt

"I used coconut oil as a face cleanser, makeup remover, moisturizer, and lip balm for maybe five months before I discovered that I'm highly reactive to it. I wouldn't say allergic because I can eat coconut just fine, but I do react to it.

Coconut oil sensitivities can cause swollen face, CCs, and painful cysts. "
"And for many people, that us not possible."
